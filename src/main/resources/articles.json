Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Sanctioned entities, like those linked to North Korean hacking groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations such as Lebanon's Hezbollah, continue to rely on cryptocurrency for fundraising, according to a new report from Chainalysis. The American blockchain analysis firm's \"2024 Crypto Crime Report\" found that $24.2 billion of illicit cryptocurrency was transferred in 2023, based on already identified illicit crypto wallets. Chainalysis retroactively updates its yearly crypto figures when new illicit wallets come to light. While last year's numbers currently represent a drop from the previous year, Chainalysis noted a much higher proportion of the funds were attributed to sanctioned or terrorist-linked recipients, accounting for about 61.5% of total illicit transaction volume in 2023. \"Actors subject to sanctions are often cut off from international traditional financial systems, and crypto can become an attempted alternative mechanism to store, send, and receive funds,\" Andrew Fierman, head of sanctions strategy at Chainalysis, told CNBC on Thursday. watch now VIDEO2:2802:28 Half of last year's crypto crime was related to sanctions on Russia: Chainalysis CEO Street Signs Asia Crypto to avert sanctions Entities like the crypto \"mixer\" Tornado Cash and Garantex took the lion's share of illicit funds in 2023. Tornado Cash was sanctioned in August 2022 for its role in laundering crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. Russian-based exchange Garantex was sanctioned in April 2022 for its affiliation with illicit actors, including ransomware groups. Crypto mixers are software that obscure the history and origin of digital assets sent through them. The amount of crypto transferred to sanctioned entities has climbed in recent years in tandem with a greater share of new trade restrictions specifying crypto wallets. In 2023, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list imposed a total of 18 new sanctions on individuals and entities, including their associated crypto wallets. At least nine of the new sanctions were against individuals and entities across China and Latin America for their alleged role in fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking. Meanwhile, five of the sanctions targeted entities deemed to have violated sanctions on North Korea. watch now VIDEO5:1905:19 How Tornado Cash blacklist by U.S. Treasury affects wider crypto ecosystem Crypto World The top crypto recipient added to the sanctions list last year was Sinbad.io \u2014 a bitcoin mixer that was shut down in November of 2023 \u2014 which received $665.4 million in crypto from the Lazarus Group. Still, sanctions have shown the ability to slow the flow of crypto funds to their targets. Tornado Cash's monthly inflows dropped by as much as 93% immediately following its placement on the U.S. list, according to Chainalysis. Though the firm noted inflows slowly rebounded from that low in the following months. Of sanctioned countries, Iran was a major recipient of illicit funds, with 73.3% of inflows coming from international mainstream exchanges indicating the services might be used to subvert sanctions, Chainalysis said. Terrorist financing Illicit crypto volume identified by Chainalysis as terrorist financing accounted for a much smaller proportion than that of transactions to sanctioned entities in 2022. Chainalysis argued that, contrary to popular belief, cryptocurrency is not an effective tool for terrorism funding because blockchain allows funds to be traced at a level of detail not typically available in traditional finance. \"The transparent nature of cryptocurrency combined with blockchain analytics provides an invaluable forensic tool that empowers governments to identify, trace, and disrupt the flow of funds \u2013 something that isn't possible with other forms of value transfer, especially cash,\" said Chanalysis's Fierman. Despite these obstacles, terrorist organizations have continued to try to utilize cryptocurrencies for fundraising, deploying intricate networks of crypto exchanges and service providers, the report said. watch now VIDEO7:2907:29 TRM Labs' Ari Redbord explains the role of crypto in terror financing Squawk Box Last year, tracing efforts resulted in the seizure of millions in funds. In one such case, Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing said in June that it had seized $1.7 million of cryptocurrency linked to Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force through a Syria-based financial facilitator named Tawfiq Muhammad Said Al-Law. Chainalysis's report outlined how Al-Law's relied on a network of legitimate mainstream exchanges and an extensive network of wallets for cryptocurrency transactions to aid Hezbollah's cryptocurrency financing infrastructure. The wallets linked to Al-Law collectively received funds ranging from millions to over $1 billion in cryptocurrency, involving up to tens of thousands of transfers. Meanwhile, entities and individuals linked to designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS and Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, have continued to solicit cryptocurrency through crowdfunding efforts. watch now VIDEO9:5609:56 U.S. announces new sanctions against Hamas operatives using crypto: CNBC Crypto World Crypto World However, according to Fierman, efforts in tracing and seizing these funds have become increasingly sophisticated. \"The data also shows that as crypto adoption by illicit actors continues to grow, sanctioning bodies like OFAC are continually evolving their methods to identify these actors and disrupt their activities,\" he added. In another example cited in the Chainalysis report, Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced their decision to stop accepting crypto donations last year due to the risk of potential donors being traced. This followed reports that Hamas had received large amounts of cryptocurrencies in the lead up to its attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Although terrorism financing is a \"small share\" of illicit crypto activity, it still presents an \"ever-present concern\" in the ecosystem, said Chainalysis in its report. Strengthened public and private partnerships are needed to help bolster these efforts and to decipher between illicit actors and funds sent to conflict zones for legitimate causes, it added."

Christopher Furlong | Getty Images LONDON \u2014 A former British finance minister on Wednesday joined cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as a global advisor, beefing up the company's regulatory bargaining power at a time when it faces severe scrutiny stateside. Coinbase announced that George Osborne, who served as Britain's chancellor of the exchequer from 2010 to 2016, will join the company on its global advisory council. He'll join the likes of Mark Esper, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense and Patrick Toomey (R-PA) on the council, which is in place to \"advise Coinbase on our global strategy as we grow our reach around the world.\" Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's chief policy officer, said the company was \"pleased to have George join our council at an exciting time for us in the U.K. and globally.\" \"George brings with him a wealth of experience in business, journalism and government. We look forward to relying on his insights and experiences as we grow Coinbase around the world,\" Shirzard added. Osborne will serve in an advisory capacity at Coinbase, helping connect the company with politicians and regulators to help further the cause of forming crypto-friendly regulations. While chancellor of the exchequer, Osborne launched a slew of austerity policies aimed at reducing the budget deficit, including freezing child benefits, reducing housing benefits, and implementing a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers. He also tried to stimulate business activity by cutting corporation tax. watch now VIDEO3:5803:58 Price compression of bitcoin trading begins today, says Mizuho's Dan Dolev The Exchange Osborne was temporarily editor-in-chief at London's Evening Standard newspaper after completing his tenure as Britain's finance minister.

I look forward to working with the team there as they build a new future in financial services,\" Osborne continued. Osborne's ties with Coinbase aren't new Suggestions of a growing relationship between Osborne and Coinbase first emerged last year, when Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong spoke onstage in a fireside moderated by Osborne at a fintech event in London. Osborne subsequently spoke with Coinbase's chief financial officer, Alesia Haas, at a fireside chat in the Belvedere Hotel during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It comes as Coinbase has made something of a land grab across Europe, expanding in multiple countries over the last few months with new licenses in place. The company was granted a virtual asset service provider license in France last month, paving the way for expansion of its services there. It has also recently secured licenses in Spain, Singapore, and Bermuda. Coinbase is currently facing a harsh regulatory crackdown in the U.S. where the Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the company of violating securities laws. Coinbase denies the allegations. watch now VIDEO7:0807:08 Galaxy Digital's Michael Novogratz on bitcoin ETFs: An amazing product for consumers & institutions Squawk Box Last year, Coinbase chief Armstrong appeared on stage with Osborne at the Innovate Finance Global Summit conference in London.

Anything including, you know, relocating,\" Armstrong told Osborne. He told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the time that Coinbase was \"looking at other markets\" as it considers its position from a regulatory standpoint. Armstrong did later clarify in an interview with CNBC's Dan Murphy that Coinbase had no formal plans to relocate from its U.S. headquarters in San Francisco. \"Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas,\" Armstrong said. \"We're always going to have a U.S. presence ... But the U.S. is a little bit behind right now.\""

One of the concerns about the AI models \u2014 the kind that underpin applications like ChatGPT \u2014 is that the data they are trained on could contain biases or misinformation. That means the answers an AI system may give would contain those biases and false information. Blockchain hit the market in 2009 with the launch of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. In the context of bitcoin, the technology is an immutable and tamper-proof public ledger of transactions. Businesses have been looking to put these principles to use in other applications for blockchain, which is sometimes referred to as distributed ledger technology. In the case of AI, training data can be put on the blockchain. That will allow the developers of the AI system to keep track of the data that the model has been trained on. Casper Labs, a business-focused blockchain firm, partnered with IBM this month to create such a system. \"The product that we are developing, the datasets are actually checkpointed and stored on the blockchain so you have a proof of how the AI is trained,\" Medha Parlikar, chief technology officer and co-founder of Casper Labs, told CNBC during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. \"And so as you use the AI, if it's learning and you find that the AI is starting to hallucinate, you can actually roll back the AI. And so you can undo some of the learning and go back to a previous version of the AI.\" Hallucinations broadly refer to when an AI system gives out false information. Blockchain is a technology that has been spoken about for many years, and a host of industries ranging from finance to health care have been looking at ways to use it. Sheila Warren, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said, however, that a blockchain-based AI training data ledger could be the \"killer use case\" for the technology. \"I actually do think that the verification of an AI and sort of the checks and balances ... within an AI system, are going to be blockchain driven and blockchain backed,\" Warren told CNBC during the panel."

His comments gave rise to expectations the Fed is probably done raising interest rates for now, as the series of rate hikes since March 2022 have cut into economic activity.

The targeted projects include the HTX digital currency exchange, formerly known as Huobi, from which hackers drained around $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. So-called blockchain bridge Heco Chain, was also attacked, HTX confirmed. Sun, who is an investor in HTX and linked to the Heco Chain, confirmed the events. A blockchain bridge connects different networks to allow the fast swap and movement of various cryptocurrencies,. These chains have proven to be vulnerable to hacking. Market analytics firm CryptoQuant assesses that a total of $85.4 million worth of cryptocurrency has been stolen from the Heco Chain. It was largely denominated in stablecoin USDT and ether. A large amount of HTX's native cryptocurrency, HBTC, was also stolen. The price of HBTC was down more than 5% versus 24 hours before, according to data from CoinGecko. CNBC has reached out to HTX for comment on Heco Chain losses. HTX said that it is identifying the source of the attack and \"has implemented urgent measures to protect user assets.\" The exchange has temporarily suspended deposit and withdrawal services on both HTX and Heco Chain as a \"precautionary measure.\" The company also said that it will \"fully compensate for any losses incurred due to the hot wallet attack.\" A hot wallet refers to a cryptocurrency wallet which is connected to the internet. CryptoQuant data showed that around 11,100 ether tokens have been moved from the HTX exchange in the last few hours. This is around $23 million worth of cryptocurrency and is mainly the result of hackers stealing the digital coins, as well as a few users trying to get their money from the exchange, a spokesperson for CryptoQuant told CNBC. CryptoQuant analyst Bradley Park said the hackers are switching their stolen assets into the more liquid ether asset because stablecoins USDT and USDC can be frozen. Tether, which issues USDT and Circle, the company behind USDC, were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. The HTX hack comes after another exchange backed by Sun, Poloniex, suffered a hack this month that led $100 million worth of cryptocurrencies being stolen."

Photographer: Lionel Ng\/Bloomberg via Getty Images Lionel Ng | Bloomberg | Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 There isn't enough justification for the widespread use of central bank digital currencies right now, which makes broad adoption of such assets \"difficult,\" Ashok Venkateswaran, Mastercard's blockchain and digital assets lead for Asia-Pacific, told CNBC. \"The difficult part is adoption. So if you have CBDCs in your wallet, you should have the ability for you to spend it anywhere you want \u2013 very similar to cash today,\" said Venkateswaran on the sidelines of Singapore FinTech Festival on Wednesday. A retail CBDC, which is the digital form of fiat currency issued by a central bank, caters to individuals and businesses, facilitating everyday transactions. This is different from a wholesale CBDC which is used exclusively by central banks, commercial banks and other financial institutions to settle large-value interbank transactions. The International Monetary Fund has said that CBDCs are \"a safe and low-cost alternative\" to cash, with approximately 60% of countries in the world exploring CBDCs. However, only 11 countries have adopted them, with an additional 53 in advanced planning stages and 46 researching the topic as of June, according to data from the Atlantic Council. \"But [building infrastructure to facilitate that] takes a lot of time and effort on a part of the country to do that. But a lot of the central banks nowadays have gotten very innovative because they are working very closely with private companies like ours, to create that ecosystem,\" said the Asia-Pacific lead. Even then, Venkateswaran said consumers are \"so comfortable using today's type of money\" that \"there isn't enough justification to have a CBDC.\" Mastercard, the second-largest card network in the U.S., said last week it has completed testing of its solution in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's e-HKD pilot program to simulate the use of a retail CBDC such as electronic Hong Kong dollars. Hong Kong's CBDC sandbox facilitates the trial of minting, distributing and spending of e-HKD within the program. VIDEO9:1709:17 Mastercard and Visa have been practically unstoppable, says Jim Cramer Mad Money with Jim Cramer A total of 16 companies across the financial, payments and technology sectors including Mastercard participated in the pilot. Mastercard's rival Visa also took part in the project alongside HSBC Bank and Hang Seng Bank, testing the viability of tokenized deposits in business-to-business payments. Venkateswaran cited Singapore as an example where the case for retail CBDC is not compelling enough as the city-state has a \"very efficient\" payments system. Last year, the IMF's deputy managing director Bo Li named Singapore and Thailand as the countries in Asia which have made \"quick progress\" by connecting fast payment systems, therefore lowering transaction fees for cross-border payments. \"There isn't a reason for a retail CBDC [in Singapore] but there is a case for a wholesale CBDC for interbank settlements,\" said Venkateswaran. On Thursday, Singapore's central bank announced it will be piloting the live issuance and use of wholesale CBDCs from 2024. During the pilot, the Monetary Authority of Singapore will collaborate with domestic banks to test the use of wholesale CBDCs to facilitate domestic payments, said the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Ravi Menon. It really depends on the need of the country or what problem they are trying to solve, said Mastercard's Venkateswaran. It won't work \"if you're only trying to replace your existing domestic payment network,\" he said. \"But if it's a country where the domestic payment network is not as robust, it may make sense to have a CBDC.\""

Project Ubin was successfully completed in 2021 after five phases of experimentation. Some of the partners included Singapore's largest bank DBS and sovereign wealth fund Temasek.

Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital form of an asset on a blockchain. The CBDC will then be automatically transferred to the merchant as a form of payment during the transaction. \"So clearing and settlement occurs in a single step on the same infrastructure, unlike the current system in which clearing and settlement take place on different systems and settlement occurs with a lag,\" said Menon. watch now VIDEO2:4202:42 Singapore is a safe haven in a 'difficult' global environment: Morgan Stanley Squawk Box Asia On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund's managing director urged the public sector to keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future. \"We have not yet reached land.

Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty Images SINGAPORE \u2014 Central bank digital currencies have the potential to replace cash, but adoption could take time, said Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday. \"CBDCs can replace cash which is costly to distribute in island economies,\" she said Wednesday at the Singapore FinTech Festival. \"They can offer resilience in more advanced economies. And they can improve financial inclusion where few hold bank accounts.\" CBDCs are the digital form of a country's fiat currency, which are regulated by the country's central bank. They are powered by blockchain technology, allowing central banks to channel government payments directly to households. \"CBDCs would offer a safe and low-cost alternative [to cash]. They would also offer a bridge to go between private monies and a yardstick to measure their value, just like cash today which we can withdraw from our banks,\" the IMF chief said. The IMF has said that more than 100 countries are exploring CBDCs \u2013 or approximately 60% of countries in the world. \"The level of global interest in CBDCs is unprecedented. Several central banks have already launched pilots or even issued a CBDC,\" the IMF said in a September report. According to a 2022 survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, of the 86 central banks surveyed, 93% said they were exploring CBDCs, while 58% said they were likely to or may possibly issue a retail CBDC in either the short or medium term. But as of June, only 11 countries have adopted CBDCs, with an additional 53 in advanced planning stages and 46 researching the topic, according to data from the Atlantic Council. ... this is not the time to turn back. The public sector should keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future. Kristalina Georgieva Managing director, IMF Referring to a 2018 speech by her predecessor Christine Lagarde, when the former IMF chief encouraged policymakers to follow the \"winds of change\" and explore the use of CBDCs, Georgieva said: \"Five years on, I'm here to provide an update on that voyage.\" \"First, countries did set sail. Many are investigating CBDCs and are developing regulation to guide digital money developments,\" said Georgieva referring to the speech. On Wednesday, the fund launched a CBDC handbook as a reference guide for policymakers around the world.

There is so much more space for innovation and so much uncertainty over use-cases,\" Georgieva told an audience which included industry experts, investors and journalists. \"In some countries the case seems dim today, but even they should remain open to potentially deploy CBDCs tomorrow. Why?\" said Georgieva. \"This is not the time to turn back.\" \"The public sector should keep preparing to deploy CBDCs and related payment platforms in the future. Fourth, these platforms should be designed from the start to facilitate cross-border payments, including with CBDCs,\" the managing director said. Potential of CBDCs Countries that have issued retail CBDC include the Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria. Singapore's Monetary Authority of Singapore has said that cash is \"generally incompatible\" with the digital economy. In a 2021 report, the country's central bank said the demand for cash as a means of payment is set to decline further. According to the BIS, using CBDCs for cross-border payments could lower the costs of obtaining, storing and spending foreign currency, depending on design and regulations. Georgieva also said that artificial intelligence \"could amplify some of the benefits of CBDCs\" by providing accurate credit scoring and personalized support. Demand for generative AI has boomed following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November last year, which was estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users within two months after launch. \"It could improve financial inclusion by providing rapid, accurate credit scoring based on various data. It could provide personalized support to people with low financial literacy,\" said Georgieva. \"To be sure, we need to protect personal privacy and data security, and avoid embedded biases so we don't perpetuate inequality but aim to reduce it. Managed prudently, AI could help,\" she added."

The development is a sign of how traditional financial institutions are growing wary of working with the company as it faces intense regulatory scrutiny and wider concerns around financial compliance within the crypto industry. Mastercard will soon no longer offer Binance-branded cards in Latin America and the Middle East, which let customers user their crypto to purchase goods, Binance said Thursday via X, the company formerly known as Twitter. \"The product, like most debit cards, has been utilized by Binance's users to pay for basic daily expenses but in this case, the cards are funded with crypto assets,\" Binance Customer Support said on Twitter. \"Only a tiny portion of our users (less than 1% of users in the markets mentioned) are impacted by this.

Mastercard confirmed that it is ending the partnership, with a spokesperson telling CNBC that, from Sept. 22, four pilot Binance co-branded Mastercard card programs the company had with Binance in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain \"will no longer be in use.\" \"This provides cardholders with a wind-down period to convert any holdings in their Binance wallet,\" the Mastercard spokesperson said. \"There is no impact on any other crypto card program.\" Visa, meanwhile, also moved to distance itself from Binance. The company ended a similar card tie-up with Binance, as it ceased issuing new co-branded cards with the firm in Europe as of July, a spokesperson for the company told Bloomberg. Binance and Visa were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. It's a sign of how crypto continues to face a broadly tepid response from the financial services industry. Backlash Mastercard had warmed to crypto in recent years. In Oct. 2021, the firm began allowing any bank or merchant the ability to offer crypto services. Last year, the company launched a product allowing banks to assess the risk of crime posed by crypto merchants, and started letting banks offer crypto trading. For its part, Mastercard said its decision to end the tie-up with Binance has \"no impact on our wider commitment to enabling and securing digital assets, which we continue to support.\" Binance faces intense backlash from regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC brought 13 charges against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao accusing the company of commingling billions of dollars in customer money with Binance's own funds, similar to allegations made against the now bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. Binance denies the allegations. The firm recently filed a protective order against the SEC, saying the regulator's requests for information were \"over broad\" and \"unduly burdensome.\" Last week, Checkout.com reportedly dropped Binance as a customer, citing \"reports of regulators actions and orders in relevant jurisdictions,\" \"inquiries from partners,\" and concerns over the firm's anti-money laundering, sanctions and compliance controls.

Str | Afp | Getty Images Vietnam's tech startups are reaping the benefits as the country sets its sights on becoming a fully digital society by 2030. In 2020, the government announced its national strategy on digital transformation, which aims to increase the digital economy's share of gross domestic product from 14% currently to 20% by 2025. The Southeast Asian nation hopes to become a high-income economy by 2045 by focusing on its digital economy. According to the World Bank, \"If digital sectors expand by about 10 percent every year, the cumulated monetary gains for the economy will exceed US$200 billion over 2021-45, or about the size of the country's current GDP.\" That's why officials are rolling out the red carpet for tech entrepreneurs. In 2021, new startup support centers Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City were announced. One year later, a roadmap for boosting innovation in science was revealed, with promises to spend 1% of GDP on scientific research. Last year, the country pledged to introduce business innovation surveys to monitor the development of startups. Vietnam's start-ups attracted a lot of investor interest in 2022, according to a recent report by venture fund Do Ventures and the National Innovation Center, a government unit under the Ministry of Planning and Investment. It ranked third in terms of deal count in Southeast Asia, and fourth in deal value last year, the report said. Notably, domestic funds were the top investors in local startups last year, accounting for 45% of total deal value. However, the total value of investment in Vietnamese startups was only $634 million in 2022 \u2014 down 56% year-on-year from the record high of $1.4 billion in 2021, the report noted. Fintech, retail, health care and payments were the most in-demand sectors for funding, it said. The country's current tech unicorns include electronic payment solutions provider VNPay, gaming startup-turned-conglomerate VNG, smartphone e-wallet Momo and blockchain player Sky Mavis, the maker of NFT-based game Axie Infinity.

In 2022, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development announced plans to build smart rural areas by 2025, specifically focused on improving production efficiency and introducing specialized digital infrastructure for farmers. \"Without going digital, transformation in farming activities and integration among stakeholders along the value chain would be a downward spiral for Vietnam agriculture, not only affecting farmers' lives, but also all others,\" said Tran Thi Nguyen, founder of Koima, an agritech startup. It helps small-scale farmers increase their income, transform their traditional farm to agroforestry, which improves biodiversity, and gain access to financing without high interest rates through its crowdfunding platform. Buzzworthy sectors Speaking to CNBC, a number of local investors identified their core areas of focus, which range from retail to logistics. Venture capital firm ThinkZone Ventures has invested in 17 local tech-enabled startups with a collective valuation of nearly $200 million since the company was started in 2018. It believes health care, food and logistics, including transportation and delivery solutions, are particularly ripe for technology disruption. Each one boasts compelling growth potential based on soaring consumer activity from Vietnam's expanding middle class, a company spokesperson said. VinaCapital calls itself one of the first venture capital investors in Vietnam. It's invested in 18 early-stage tech startups through its $100 million platform, VinaCapital Ventures, as well as maintaining 58 direct investments through its portfolio companies. It prioritizes startups that provide tech-enabled solutions to improve existing systems in agriculture, financial services, logistics, media and retail. Emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, and electric vehicle infrastructure are some areas it believes will drive economic transformation going forward. watch now VIDEO3:3103:31 Slowdown in Vietnam's economy is 'very temporary': Investment management firm Squawk Box Asia VIC Partners said it has invested in about 15 innovative companies since 2017, injecting around $100,000 to $200,000 for the first check in each deal, followed by another $100,000 to $200,000 in the following round. Managing director Tung A. Tran said VIC is particularly bullish about ecommerce. \"We have invested in B2B SaaS companies that enable ecommerce businesses in recruitment, sales, marketing, payment, customer care, logistics and fulfilment,\" he said, referring to cloud-based software programs that service the corporate world. \"We also invest in innovative ecommerce companies that sell directly to consumers through social media and implement technology in seamless business operations.\" Challenges ahead Despite the influx of capital entering the digital tech field, investors warn of several structural obstacles that could limit growth going forward. At the top of the list was regulatory framework such as tax, intellectual property rights and data protection required to create the most conducive environment for tech. \"The absence of global-class human resources is also a prevailing issue,\" ThinkZone noted. \"While Vietnam possesses skilled and seasoned professionals in programming, development, design, and various other roles, they have yet to reach the pinnacle of excellence.\" watch now VIDEO3:1703:17 Huge number of foreign investors returning to Vietnam: Portfolio manager Squawk Box Asia \"Limited investment in research and development by large corporations is a significant obstacle for Vietnamese startups,\" according to VinaCapital. \"It limits the potential for cross-industry collaboration and innovation, making it more difficult for startups to find potential acquirers or partners who are interested in their products or services.\" VIC Partners is most concerned about the global economic downturn. The firm expects cash flow issues to wipe out many tech startups in 2023 and 2024 while pushing more young people to pursue traditional business models, which would deprive the startup market of new ideas. Once capital inflows are injected again into the developed market, it will take some time to trickle down to emerging countries like Vietnam, and then from the listed market to private equity and venture capital players, said Tran from VIC Partners. \"I predict 2023 and 2024 to be very good years for pre-IPO and [private equity] opportunities. Then from 2025-2026, the VC market in Vietnam may flourish again with another batch of great companies.\""

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Cryptocurrency exchange Binance said it will leave the Netherlands after the company's application to register under the Dutch crypto authorization regime was rejected. Referring to a virtual asset service provider, Binance on Friday said that it could no longer serve Dutch clients \"as we have been unable to register as a VASP with the Dutch regulator.\" The company didn't give a reason for why it was unable to receive a license from regulators. Starting Friday, no new Binance users will be accepted onto the platform. From July 17, Binance said it will cease allowing users to buy tokens, trade, or make deposits, although its withdrawal function remains active. Binance recommended that users withdraw their assets from their accounts. The Dutch central bank, which is responsible for authorizing new virtual asset services providers, was not immediately available for comment. Under the current regulatory regime, Binance can only get approval to operate in an EU country by registering under its money laundering prevention rules. The firm has so far received such approvals in France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania. This is set to change once the EU approves its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA aims to harmonize crypto regulation across the bloc and to prevent bad actors from harming consumers, particularly in the wake of the shock bankruptcy of FTX in November. Once MiCA comes into force, crypto firms with registration in one EU country will be able to then use that to offer their services across other member states. Binance said it remains \"committed to working collaboratively with regulators around the world and are additionally focused on getting our business ready to be fully MiCA compliant.\" \"Existing Dutch resident users are being sent an email with comprehensive information about what this means for their accounts and any assets they currently have on the Binance platform, alongside any steps they will need to take,\" a Binance spokesperson told CNBC. \"While Binance is disappointed that this has become necessary, it will continue to engage productively and transparently with Dutch regulators.\" The latest blow to the crypto giant follows a tumultuous few months for the broader cryptocurrency industry. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao, alleging that they engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities and commingled investor funds with their own.

Bryan van der Beek | Bloomberg | Getty Images The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, doubled down on his criticisms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chief Gary Gensler Monday, but added the exchange would not leave the U.S. despite the regulatory uncertainty the company is facing in the country. Coinbase has been under intense regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. lately following a grim year for the crypto industry which saw major companies like FTX and Terra fail, prices plunge, and investors lose billions of dollars in the process. The SEC earlier this year served Coinbase with a Wells Notice, a letter that the regulator sends to a company or firm at the conclusion of an SEC investigation that states the SEC is planning to bring an enforcement action against them. At the heart of the regulator's dispute with Coinbase, and a host of other crypto companies, is the allegation that it is selling unregistered securities to investors. Coinbase disputes this. \"The SEC is a bit of an outlier here,\" Armstrong told CNBC's Dan Murphy in an interview in Dubai Monday. \"There's kind of a lone crusade, if you will, with Gary Gensler, the chair there, and he has taken a more anti-crypto view for some reason.\" \"I don't think he's necessarily trying to regulate the industry as much as maybe curtail it. But he's created some lawsuits, and I think it's quite unhelpful for the industry in the U.S. writ large, but it also is an opportunity for Coinbase to go get that clarity from the courts that we feel will really benefit the crypto industry and also the U.S. more broadly.\" watch now VIDEO1:5701:57 The financial system is in 'major need' of an update, Coinbase CEO says Capital Connection The SEC declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. Armstrong also rowed back on a suggestion he made last month that the company may be forced to move its headquarters overseas. \"Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas,\" Armstrong said. \"We're always going to have a U.S. presence ... But the U.S. is a little bit behind right now.\" \"I would say we're seeing more thoughtful approaches, for instance, in the EU [European Union], they've actually already passed comprehensive crypto legislation, the U.K. has been incredibly welcoming, and for us there, and that's been a hub where we've decided to serve the U.K. market.\" At a fintech conference in London in April, Armstrong said that Coinbase may consider relocating outside the U.S. if the current regulatory headwinds persist. He said the U.S. \"has the potential to be an important market in crypto\" but right now is not delivering regulatory clarity. If this goes on, he said, then Coinbase would consider options of investing more abroad, including relocating from the U.S. to elsewhere. Still, Armstrong said Monday that Coinbase was looking to increase its international investments, stating it is \"very interested\" in the United Arab Emirates as a country to do more investment in. Dubai has been a notably favorable regulator when it comes to crypto, courting business from the likes of Binance and Kraken. Noting that it was his first visit to the UAE, Armstrong said: \"I'm here to learn and listen and meet with the relevant regulators both in Abu Dhabi and here in Dubai and decide if this is a good place for us to serve a large region of the world.\" watch now VIDEO4:1404:14 UAE putting out a 'clear rulebook' on cryptocurrency regulation: Coinbase CEO Capital Connection"

Justin Chapman told CNBC's \"Crypto World\" at the Digital Assets Week conference in San Francisco that institutions have shifted their focus to cryptocurrencies' underlying blockchain technology, but that his firm \"has capabilities\" in place should client interest in crypto assets rebound. \"Just after March the crypto market went off a cliff\u2026 the client interest has definitely gone off the same cliff in terms of institutional interest in in cryptocurrencies,\" he said. \"It's definitely quiet now, since 2022, from the institutional side,\" he continued. \"Before that, we were seeing traditional fund managers looking to launch crypto funds, ETPs in Europe, which is the equivalent of ETFs in the U.S. \u2014 that's really gone quiet. Even the hedge funds, who are pretty active in the markets, have certainly reduced their exposure within that particular space.\" Meanwhile, leaders from the biggest financial institutions gathered at the San Francisco conference were energized when it came to the blockchain technology \u2013 specifically its potential to help tokenize real-world assets like gold for clients. The \"evolution of the technology\" is moving into a \"better place\" in terms of support from market participants, Chapman said. \"As a firm, we have capabilities that sit there to administer [crypto trading] functions, but it's a pretty quiet market at the moment and [after] most of the issues we had last year, we haven't seen a rebound at all on the institutional side yet,\" he said. Specifically, Northern Trust partnered with Standard Chartered in 2020 to launch Zodia, a crypto custodian for institutional investors. Bitcoin has gained almost 75% this year after losing 64% in 2022. Trading was still to begin the year, with volatility falling to historic lows. The regulatory crackdown in the U.S. been a dark cloud over the industry while the banking crisis has helped push bitcoin's price higher. Both have brought volatility back to the market. Even as bitcoin currently struggles to break above the $30,000 level, investors agree it remains in a long-term uptrend. \"We're not focused that much on the asset class because the client isn't at the moment,\" Chapman said. \"So we're not seeing that appetite to have that within their portfolios. If that changes, as a firm, we can account for those capabilities. But it's certainly lost its shine from the institutional perspective.\""

S3studio | Getty Images The XRP cryptocurrency soared on Wednesday as investors grew hopeful that Ripple, a company closely associated with the token, would win its prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The token was worth around 45 cents at about 8 a.m. ET, according to data from CoinGecko, up over 11% in the last 24 hours. It was earlier trading up as much as 20%. Traders pointed to a supplemental notice submitted by Ripple on Monday which pointed to a ruling in a separate case concerning Binance.US' rescue plan for collapsed crypto lender Voyager Digital. Under the plan, Binance's U.S. unit was to buy all of Voyager's assets, including its native VGX token, in a $1.3 billion deal. The SEC rejected the plan, arguing VGX was akin to a security and calling Binance an unregistered securities exchange, according to the notice from Ripple. However, the judge rejected the SEC's objections and approved the bankruptcy plan citing what he called the \"vagueness\" of the regulator's arguments and stating the SEC had not \"offered any guidance at all as to just what it was that the Debtors allegedly were supposed to prove\" to demonstrate VGX was not a security, according to the Ripple letter. The SEC wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. The SEC accuses Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen of breaching U.S. securities laws by selling XRP without first registering it with the regulator. Ripple contests the SEC's allegations, maintaining the view that XRP should be considered a digital currency rather than a security. Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC Wednesday morning that she was \"very hopeful\" about achieving a positive resolution to the SEC battle, adding she thinks it will reach a conclusion sometime this year. watch now VIDEO5:4905:49 Ripple optimistic about reaching positive resolution to SEC case, president says Squawk Box Europe Long said she thinks it's \"very unlikely\" the judge will rule in favor of the SEC \"considering by our view both the facts and the law are on our side.\" If XRP were to be deemed a security, it could have huge ramifications for the digital currency industry. Floods of tokens may end up falling into the same category, making them regulated financial instruments that would need SEC supervision and frequent transparency disclosures. Market sentiment improving Ripple and the SEC have now both submitted their final round of briefs seeking a summary judgment to the case. The case now rests with Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, who is expected to issue a verdict soon. It is not clear when she will make her decision. However, some crypto investors believe an outcome will arrive in the coming days. XRP \"is being bolstered by a potential positive outcome in the SEC case,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international at crpyto exchange Luno, told CNBC via email Wednesday. The token, which is the sixth-largest globally by market value, is also being boosted by the broader crypto market sentiment, Ayyar said. Bitcoin is up 70% since the start of the year and is currently trading above $28,000 for the first time in nine months. Ether, the second-biggest token, has risen 50% year-to-date. \"Overall, crypto markets have rallied in the past week or so, given the anticipation of a pause or slow down in interest rates and the slowdown in inflation,\" according to Ayyar. Regulation by enforcement? Ripple's Long said she believed the SEC was regulating through enforcement rather than establishing clear regulations for the sector. Europe is more advanced in its treatment of crypto, she argued, highlighting the bloc's Markets in Crypto Assets regulation as an example. \"We're seeing action through enforcement vs. setting clear rules and regulation which is what all of us in the industry desire,\" Long said. \"Europe is really emerging as a leader in setting really clear regulations and rules that allow crypto companies and also traditional finance to embrace crypto.\" For its part, the SEC has said it wants all crypto companies and projects to bring their operations into compliance with federal securities laws. In an interview with CNBC in February after a crackdown on the crypto exchange Kraken, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, \"There's a handful of tokens that have actually registered. The intermediaries, the storefronts if you wish, the casinos that people are investing in and investing at need to properly comply and disentangle these bundled products.\" \"If this field has any chance of survival and success, it's time-tested rules and laws to protect the investing public.\" In recent weeks, the regulator has taken aim at numerous crypto firms alleging they are engaged in illegal securities offerings. Stablecoin issuer Paxos said the SEC served it with a notice threatening legal action over claims that BUSD, the native stablecoin of crypto exchange Binance, was a security that should have been registered with the regulator. The regulator also hit crypto lender Genesis and exchange Gemini with charges alleging a high-yield investment product offered by the two companies should have been treated as a security.

No blockchain. And your own personal artificial intelligence assistant, like ChatGPT. These are all part of the vision of the future of the web, according to internet inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and CEO of Inrupt John Bruce, who spoke on CNBC's Beyond The Valley podcast published Friday. Inrupt is a company they co-founded which aims to deliver the web inventors' original vision of the way the internet should work. Berners-Lee said that when he invented the web in 1989, \"if you were sufficiently switched on geeky, you could get yourself a computer. And you could put a web server on it, you could plug it into the internet. And you could have a website.\" \"The spirit of the web was incredibly empowering to individuals,\" he said. But in his view, something has gone wrong since, with the concentration of power now in the hands of large internet companies. Through their company Inrupt, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and John Bruce, are trying to change the future of the internet. Their vision is a future where users have more control over their data. Sam Barnes | Sportsfile | Getty Images \"Well, everybody's on Facebook, so they don't have the website. They all use Mark Zuckerberg's website,\" Berners-Lee said. \"When people look you up on Facebook, you don't control actually what they see ... Mark Zuckerberg's algorithms control what news gets fed to them as they're looking at your stuff,\" he told CNBC. \"That's very disempowering. It is very useful to Facebook. They have a lot of data about people that they they use for targeting them with advertisements ... but what we've lost is the ability for individuals to have power.\" In control of data His solution? A product that allows users to control their data and how it's used. Currently, internet companies collect data on users by default, as a way of using their services. But Berners-Lee and Bruce's start-up Inrupt is working on a different way forward. The aim is for users to have a single sign-on across different products and services on the internet. Data will be stored in so-called \"pods,\" which are basically a person's personal data online storage container. Individuals can grant a website or service access to their pod, or silo of data, rather than websites taking data by default. The system is built on an open protocol on the internet called Solid. \"And that's the 'yin' and the 'yang' of Inrupt, which is the personal empowerment. And the opportunity for individuals to take more command over their role on the web,\" Bruce told CNBC's Beyond The Valley. watch now VIDEO2:4702:47 China's tech giants announce their plans for ChatGPT rivals Squawk Box Europe Such an idea would require buy-in from large internet players. But Bruce said there is an \"endless trudge\" from companies to get more data on users, so they can target them with products and services. But the endeavour is showing diminishing returns for companies, he said. \"The other way of doing it is instead of, you know, figuring out blindly 'Are you the likely candidate for my product or service?' How about I just ask you in a legitimate way? And you tell me,\" Bruce said, referencing the idea that users would be able to share the data that they want with companies from their pod. Users will also need to change their behavior, and there needs to be a desire to control their data in this way. Berners-Lee admitted this change wouldn't come overnight but instead \"bit by bit.\" Your own personal A.I. assistant In the wide-ranging Beyond The Valley episode, Bruce and Berners-Lee also addressed new artificial intelligence product ChatGPT which was developed by OpenAI. Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot, that responds to questions from users. Berners-Lee said that users can run their own AI, much like their own personal version of Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, when they have their own data pods. That's because in the future that Berners-Lee sees, users will have all sorts of data stored in their pods \u2014 from fitness information to online shopping habits. The AI could use all that data to learn and be able to assist a user. \"Sometimes you have the whole data spectrum \u2014 all of the data to do with your collaborations and your coffees and your projects and your dreams. And the books you're reading and ... all of your life, then that is in your pod. You run AI on that. That could be sweet,\" Berners-Lee said. Web3 or Web 3.0? What Berners-Lee and Bruce are working on at Inrupt is all part of the future of the internet. Some have termed it Web3, which proponents say will be a decentralized version of the internet \u2014 one that is not dominated by a handful of powerful players such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Many Web3 advocates suggest it will be built on some sort of blockchain technology. Blockchain is the technology that first came to light with bitcoin but has since evolved. But Berners-Lee is keen to call the next generation of the internet Web 3.0, emphasizing the dot. \"It's not blockchain,\" he said. watch now VIDEO50:0450:04 What is Web3? We ask the man who invented the word Beyond the Valley Videos Web3 proponents suggest blockchain could be used to underpin the future of the internet. But Berners-Lee said the technology is not fast enough nor does it afford enough privacy. He also said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are \"only speculative.\" Gavin Wood, founder of blockchain infrastructure company Parity Technologies, coined the term \"Web3.\" Wood spoke to CNBC last year about his vision for the future of the web in a previous episode of Beyond the Valley. He advocated blockchain technology as part of the future web make-up."

Circle, the company behind the stablecoin USDC, was one the few present. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Over the past few years at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the number of cryptocurrency industry attendees has boomed. But after a near $1.4 trillion wipeout in 2022, the crypto industry is being a bit more reserved with how it splashes the cash and several companies spotted last year are not in attendance. 2022 was marked by failed crypto projects, liquidity issues and bankruptcies, topped off by the collapse of major exchange FTX. When the World Economic Forum was held last May, bitcoin was hovering around $30,000, after having already fallen more than 50% from its all-time high hit in November 2021. More pain followed with bitcoin dipping as low as $15,480. The Promenade is the main street in Davos where companies and governments take over shops and cafes for the week. Last year, crypto firms from all walks of life took over the place. But since the market slide, there are far fewer crypto firms with flashy store fronts at Davos. One shop selling non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, has disappeared. Prices of NFTs, which are digital collectibles, also plunged last year. What's left are companies that survived the bear market and that are looking to expand their businesses. \"It's very clear that the speculation period is drawing to a close and every company that you see featured \u2026 is really focused on real-world use cases,\" said Teana Baker-Taylor, vice-president of policy and regulatory strategy at Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin.

USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Circle says it is backed with real-world assets such as U.S. Treasurys so that one USDC can be redeemed for $1. Casper Labs, a company that has built a blockchain designed to be used by businesses, is running a space on the Promenade called the Blockchain Lab. Casper Labs was also present last year in Davos. Cliff Sarkin, chief of strategic relations at Casper Labs, said he's \"cautiously optimistic\" that the crypto market has bottomed. \"So we're over a year into the bear market, so I think the shock of that is settled in and for those of us that have been in the space for years \u2026 we feel like this is the time to build,\" Sarkin told CNBC. He added that the crypto firms that have remained at Davos are \"substantiative projects\" and \"the real deals\" versus things like NFTs. There were also those in traditional finance who welcomed fewer crypto firms. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, was asked during an event hosted by the Swiss bank what he would like to see in Davos this year. He said he had seen it already: \"It's less crypto on the main street.\" The mysterious case of the orange bitcoin car On Monday, a flashy bright orange Mercedes-Benz car was parked outside of the Blockchain Hub on the Promenade. The orange Mercedes was parked along the Promenade in Davos. Nobody in the vicinity saw who parked it there. The license plate says \"Kuna\" on it, which is the name of a Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange. Michael Chobanian, the founder of Kuna, confirmed that the car belongs to him. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC A coin that represented a bitcoin was placed where the Mercedes-Benz logo would usually be. On the tires and the licenses plate, the words \"in crypto we trust\" were printed. The license plate had the Ukrainian flag on it and the name Kuna, which is the company behind a cryptocurrency exchange of the same name. Kuna also set up the \"reserve fund of Ukraine\" after the war with Russia began where people could donate crypto to Ukraine. People in the vicinity that CNBC spoke to could not verify who parked the car there. However, two crypto executives who spoke to CNBC did not welcome the orange car, particularly after the market crash and the excesses of the industry were exposed. One remarked that the presence of such a car was not helpful for the industry's reputation which took a hit last year. CNBC reached out to Semen Kaploushenko, CEO of the Kuna exchange, via LinkedIn, but is yet to receive a response. CNBC also reached out to the Blockchain Association of Ukraine which Kuna founder Michael Chobanian is the president of, but is yet to receive a response.

Gemini, a crypto exchange, and Genesis, a crypto lender, partnered in February 2021 on a Gemini product called Earn, which touted yields of up to 8% for customers. According to the SEC, Genesis loaned Gemini users' crypto and sent a portion of the profits back to Gemini, which then deducted an agent fee, sometimes over 4%, and returned the remaining profit to its users. Genesis should have registered that product as a securities offering, SEC officials said in a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. See also: Why the Winklevoss brothers are in a $900 million crypto faceoff with Barry Silbert \"Today's charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws,\" SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. Gemini's Earn program, supported by Genesis' lending activities, met the SEC's definition by including both an investment contract and a note, SEC officials said. Those two features are part of how the SEC assesses whether an offering is a security. The SEC says the Earn program netted the companies billions of dollars in crypto assets. The agency is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties against both Genesis and Gemini, and noted that \"investigations into other securities law violations and into other entities and persons relating to the alleged misconduct are ongoing.\" The two firms have been engaged in a high-profile battle over $900 million in customer assets that Gemini entrusted to Genesis as part of the Earn program, which was shuttered this week. Genesis suspended withdrawals after the failure of FTX in November caused a rush for the exits across the crypto universe, and the firm has yet to allow Earn customers to pull their funds. \"The U.S. retail investors who participated in the Gemini Earn program have suffered significant harm,\" the SEC complaint read. More than 340,000 investors have been affected by the freeze. In the first three months of 2022, Gemini made around $2.7 million in agent fees off Earn, the SEC complaint alleges. Genesis would use Gemini users' assets for institutional lending or as \"collateral for Genesis' own borrowing,\" the agency said. Over the same period, Genesis paid out $166.2 million in interest to clients, including Gemini, on $169.8 million of interest income, the SEC said. Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss (L-R), creators of crypto exchange Gemini Trust Co. on stage at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty Images Genesis' institutional borrowers included Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, both now bankrupt. Representatives from Gemini and Genesis parent Digital Currency Group declined to comment. Gemini, which was founded in 2015 by bitcoin advocates Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has an extensive exchange business that, while beleaguered, could possibly weather an enforcement action. In a tweet, Tyler Winklevoss said Gemini is \"working hard to recover funds\" and called the SEC's action \"totally counterproductive.\" But Genesis' future is more uncertain, because the business is heavily focused on lending out customer crypto and has already engaged restructuring advisers. The crypto lender is part of DCG, the conglomerate controlled by Barry Silbert. SEC officials said the possibility of a DCG or Genesis bankruptcy had no bearing on deciding whether to pursue a charge. It's the latest in a series of recent crypto enforcement actions led by Gensler after the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange, late last year. Gensler was roundly criticized on social media and by lawmakers for the SEC's failure to impose safeguards on the nascent crypto industry. Gensler's SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, chaired by Rostin Benham, are the two regulators that oversee crypto activity in the U.S. Both agencies filed complaints against Bankman-Fried, but the SEC has, of late, ramped up the pace and the scope of enforcement actions. The SEC brought a similar action against now bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi and settled last year. Earlier this month, Coinbase settled with New York state regulators over historically inadequate know-your-customer protocols. Since Bankman-Fried was indicted on federal fraud charges in December, the SEC has filed five crypto-related enforcement actions.

The exchange plans to cut 950 jobs, according to a blog post published Tuesday morning. Coinbase, which had roughly 4,700 employees as of the end of September, already slashed 18% of its workforce in June citing a need to manage costs and growing \"too quickly\" during the bull market. \"With perfect hindsight, looking back, we should have done more,\" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in a phone interview. \"The best you can do is react quickly once information becomes available, and that's what we're doing in this case.\" Coinbase said the move would result in new expenses of between $149 million and $163 million for the first quarter. The layoffs, along with other restructuring measures, will bring Coinbase's operating expenses down by 25% for the quarter ending in March, according to a new regulatory filing. The crypto company also said it expects adjusted EBITDA losses for the full year to be within a prior $500 million \"guardrail\" set last year. After looking at various stress tests for Coinbase's annual revenue, Armstrong said, \"it became clear that we would need to reduce expenses to increase our chances of doing well in every scenario\" and there was \"no way\" to do so without reducing head count. The company will also be shutting down several projects with a \"lower probability of success.\" Cryptocurrency markets have been rocked in recent months following the collapse of one of the industry's biggest players, FTX. Armstrong pointed to that fallout, and increasing pressure on the sector thanks to \"unscrupulous actors in the industry\" referring to FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. \"The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry,\" he said, adding there's likely more \"shoes to drop.\" \"We may not have seen the last of it \u2014 there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to make sure that they're following the rules,\" Armstrong said. \"Long term that's a good thing. But short term, there's still a lot of market fear.\" Cryptocurrencies have suffered alongside technology stocks as investors flee riskier assets amid a broader economic downturn. Bitcoin is down 58% in the past year, while Coinbase shares are off by more than 83%. End of a growth era Coinbase joins a chorus of other tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the Covid pandemic. Last week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs, more than the online retailer initially estimated last year, while Salesforce reduced its head count by more than 7,000, or 10%. Elon Musk slashed about half of Twitter's workforce after taking the helm as CEO last year, and Meta cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13%. Crypto companies Genesis, Gemini and Kraken have also reduced their workforces. \"Every company in Silicon Valley felt like we were just focused on growth, growth, growth, and people were almost using their headcount number as a symbol of how much progress they were making,\" Armstrong said. \"The focus now is on operational efficiency -- it's a healthy thing for the ecosystem and the industry to focus more on those things.\" Early last year, Coinbase had said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design. Armstrong said he's now trying to shift the culture at Coinbase to \"get back to its start-up roots\" of smaller teams that can move quickly. Coinbase went public in April 2021 and has seen its share price plummet since. The stock is trading below $40 after surging as high as $429.54 on the day of its debut. Coinbase debt that's maturing in 2031 continues to trade at roughly 50 cents on the dollar. The company still had cash and equivalents of roughly $5 billion as of the end of September. Coinbase said it would email affected employees on their personal accounts, and revoke access to company systems. Armstrong acknowledged the latter \"feels sudden and harsh\" but \"it's the only prudent choice given our responsibility to protect customer information.\" Despite the industry's domino effect of bankruptcies and a marked drop in trading volume, Armstrong was steadfast in arguing that the industry isn't going away. He said the demise of FTX would ultimately benefit Coinbase, as its largest competitor is now wiped out. Regulatory clarity may also emerge, and Armstrong said it \"validates\" the company's decision of building and going public in the U.S. The CEO likened the current environment to the dot-com boom and bust. \"If you look at the internet era, the best companies got even stronger by having rigorous cost management,\" he said. \"That's what's going to happen here.\""

Mike Coppola | Getty Images Michael Rubin's sports platform company Fanatics is divesting its 60% stake in NFT company Candy Digital, according to an internal email obtained by CNBC. Fanatics, who previously held the majority share of Candy Digital, will be selling its interest to an investor group led by Galaxy Digital, the crypto merchant bank led by Mike Novogratz, which was the other original founding shareholder, according to the email. Fanatics declined to comment. Candy Digital was founded in June 2021 in the middle of the sports NFT boom, competing with companies like Dapper Labs in the digital sports collectible space. One of its first efforts came out of a multiyear licensing agreement with MLB to produce nonfungible tokens, which included an exclusive Lou Gehrig NFT. It also released digital collectibles with Netflix's Stranger Things, WWE, and several Nascar teams. However, akin to the broader NFT market, sports NFTs also saw a decline amid the 'crypto winter' that has seen the value of nearly all digital assets plummet. Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day digital trading platforms that ranked No. 9 on last year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, laid off 22% of its company in November. Candy Digital had raised a $100 million Series A round in October 2021, valuing it at $1.5 billion at the time. Investors in that round included SoftBank's Vision Fund 2, Insight Partners, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, according to previous CNBC reporting. It is unclear what Fanatics received for its stake in the company, but Rubin wrote \"Divesting our ownership stake at this time allowed us to ensure investors were able to recoup most of their investment via cash or additional shares in Fanatics \u2013 a favorable outcome for investors, especially in an imploding NFT market that has seen precipitous drops in both transaction volumes and prices for standalone NFTs.\" Rubin cited several factors for Fanatics' divesture in the email, which he wrote was a \"rather straightforward and easy decision for us to make for several reasons.\" \"Over the past year, it has become clear that NFTs are unlikely to be sustainable or profitable as a standalone business,\" Rubin wrote. \"Aside from physical collectibles (trading cards) driving 99% of the business, we believe digital products will have more value and utility when connected to physical collectibles to create the best experience for collectors.\" In January 2022, Fanatics acquired Topps trading cards for roughly $500 million after also acquiring the rights to produce MLB trading cards, severing a nearly 70-year partnership between Topps and baseball's top league. Fanatics raised $700 million in fresh capital in December, aiming to use that new money to focus on potential merger and acquisition opportunities across its collectibles, betting and gaming businesses. It also pushed the company's valuation to $31 billion. The company, which started as an e-commerce platform selling team merchandise to sports fans, has looked to expand across the entire sports ecosystem. The company is also weighing an initial public offering, and Rubin recently met with more than 90 internet, retail and gaming analysts from various Wall Street firms, where he spoke of Fanatics' growth plans, according to previous CNBC reporting. Fanatics, a three-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, was ranked No. 21 on last year's list. Here's the full email Rubin sent to Fanatics staff on Wednesday: Team Fanatics \u2013 Happy New Year. I hope everyone had a chance to recharge and spend quality time with family and friends during the holidays, and that your 2023 is off to a great start. As we're getting back into the swing of things, I wanted to share some news with all of you. Effective immediately, Fanatics has divested our approximately 60% stake in Candy Digital. We have sold our interest in the NFT company to an investor group led by Galaxy Digital, the other original founding shareholder. When we looked at all the factors on the table, this was a rather straightforward and easy decision for us to make for several reasons. Business Model \u2013 NFTs will most likely emerge as an integrated product\/feature and not as a standalone business: Over the past year, it has become clear that NFTs are unlikely to be sustainable or profitable as a standalone business. Aside from physical collectibles (trading cards) driving 99% of the business, we believe digital products will have more value and utility when connected to physical collectibles to create the best experience for collectors. To that end, we already hold a broader and more significant set of NFT and digital collectibles rights within our Fanatics Collectibles business that came with our trading cards rights (NFL, MLB, NBA and more), which we are seamlessly integrating with the world-class physical collectibles rights we currently have. Ultimately, our goal is to grow the number of sports collectors. Connectivity between physical and digital collectibles will be the most powerful way to create an emotional resonance and enduring success for NFTs and their collectors. Investor Relationships: Taking this immediate action not only makes sense for the strategic direction of Fanatics, but also allows us to maintain the integrity of the relationships with our investors. The investors in Candy bought into the vision not because of NFTs or Candy itself, but because of our track record at Fanatics. This proven track record is a result of your hard work and our alignment on the mission to build the leading global digital sports platform. Therefore, it was imperative to us to protect their investment as the market and financial environment changed. Divesting our ownership stake at this time allowed us to ensure investors were able to recoup most of their investment via cash or additional shares in Fanatics \u2013 a favorable outcome for investors, especially in an imploding NFT market that has seen precipitous drops in both transaction volumes and prices for standalone NFTs. Cultural Integration: Similar to how quickly we mobilize when the right strategic acquisition or partnership presents itself, we move even quicker when we realize things aren't working. One of our core values \u2013 One Fanatics\u2026Win As A Team \u2013 is integral to our success and only works when we can leverage the collective intelligence and expertise of all of our teams and colleagues. Unfortunately, we never achieved full integration of Candy within the Fanatics environment or culture due to shareholders with competing objectives and goals. Our culture of building, growing and winning as a team is what makes this company special, and we were not willing to compromise on this front. We are 100% confident that this was the best long-term decision for Fanatics and our partners and we look forward to growing our digital and trading cards business together under Fanatics Collectibles with the incredible rights we have across the NFL, MLB, NBA, NCAA, WWE, UFC, F1, UEFA, Disney and more.

STR | Nurphoto via Getty Images 2022 was a rough year for crypto. More than $1.3 trillion was wiped off the value of the market. And bitcoin, the world's largest digital coin, saw its price slump more than 60%. Investors were caught off guard by a wave of collapses in the industry from stablecoin project terraUSD to crypto exchange FTX, as well as a worsening macroeconomic climate. Those who made predictions about bitcoin's price in the past year really missed the mark. But with 2023 now here, some market players have stuck their neck out with price calls for what could be another volatile year. Interest rates around the world are on the rise, and that's weighing on risk assets like stocks and bitcoin. Investors are also watching how the FTX saga, which resulted in the arrest of the company's founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas, will develop. CNBC rounds up some of the boldest price calls for bitcoin in 2023. Tim Draper: $250,000 Bitcoin bull Tim Draper had one of the most optimistic calls on bitcoin of 2022, predicting the token would be worth $250,000 by the end of the year. In November, the billionaire venture capitalist said he's extending the timeline for that prediction until mid-2023. Even after the collapse of FTX, he's convinced the coin will hit the quarter-of-a-million milestone. \"My assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,\" Draper told CNBC via email. Bitcoin would need to rally 1,400% in order for it to trade at that level. Despite the depressed prices and trading volumes drying up, there could be reason to suspect the market has found a bottom, according to Draper. \"I suspect that the halvening in 2024 will have a positive run,\" he said. watch now VIDEO9:5609:56 FTX's collapse is shaking crypto to its core. The pain may not be over International Digital Originals The halvening, or halving, is an event that happens every four years in which bitcoin rewards to miners are cut in half. This is viewed by some investors as positive for bitcoin's price, as it squeezes supply. The next halving is slated to happen sometime in 2024. Bitcoin miners, who use power-intensive machines to verify transactions and mint new tokens, are being squeezed by the slump in prices and rising energy costs. These actors accumulate massive piles of digital currency, making them some of the biggest sellers in the market. With miners offloading their holdings to pay off debts, that should remove most of the remaining selling pressure on bitcoin.

Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside That's historically a good sign for bitcoin, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development at crypto exchange Luno. \"In prior down markets, miner capitulation has usually indicated major bottoms,\" Ayyar told CNBC. \"Their cost to produce becomes greater than the value of bitcoin, hence you have a number of miners either switching off their machines \u2026 or they need to sell more bitcoin to keep their business afloat.\" \"If the market reaches a point where it's absorbing this miner sell pressure sufficiently, one can assume that we're seeing a bottoming period.\" Standard Chartered: $5,000 For some market participants, the worst is yet to come. In a Dec. 5 research note, Standard Chartered said bitcoin may sink as low as $5,000. The prediction, one of the bank's list of \"surprises\" that are being \"under-priced\" by markets, would represent a 70% plunge from current prices. \"Yields plunge along with technology shares\" in Standard Chartered's nightmare 2023 scenario, \"and while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,\" said Eric Robertsen, the bank's global head of research. \"More and more crypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,\" he added. Robertsen said the scenario has a \"non-zero probability of occurring in the year ahead\" and falls \"materially outside of the market consensus or our own baseline views.\" Mark Mobius: $10,000 Veteran investor Mark Mobius had a relatively successful 2022 in terms of his price call. In May, he forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000. Loading chart... He said bitcoin would fall to $10,000 in 2022. That did not happen. However, Mobius told CNBC that he is sticking for his $10,000 price call in 2023. The investor, who made his name at Franklin Templeton Investments, told CNBC that his bear case for bitcoin stemmed from rising interest rates and general tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve. \"With higher interest rates, the attraction of holding or buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies becomes less attractive since just holding the coin does not pay interest,\" Mobius said via email. Carol Alexander: $50,000 Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, wasn't far off the mark with her prediction that bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. Now, she thinks the cryptocurrency could be set for gains \u2014 but not for reasons you might expect. The catalyst would be more dominos from the FTX fallout tipping over, Alexander said. If this happens, she expects the price of bitcoin will top $30,000 in the first quarter, and then $50,000 by quarters three or four. \"There will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble \u2014 so we won't see the price overshooting as before,\" she told CNBC. \"We'll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes.\" Alexander's reasoning is that, with trading volumes evaporating with traders on edge, large holders known as \"whales\" will likely step in to prop up the market. The wealthiest 97 bitcoin wallet addresses account for 14.15% of the total supply, according to fintech firm River Financial. watch now VIDEO4:2404:24 FTX's collapse was a punch in the face for crypto, but not a knockout blow, analyst says Squawk Box Europe Some investors have given up trying to predict the price of bitcoin.

Bitcoin was on a \"positive path\" earlier in 2022, with institutional adoption rising, but \"a few major forces interfered,\" he said. Trenchev once predicted bitcoin surging to a peak of $100,000 by early 2023. Now, he's done trying to predict the price. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, suggested attempts to forecast bitcoin's price are futile. \"We could be sitting here talking this time next year and it could be at $5,000 or 50,000 it just wouldn't surprise me because the market is so heavily driven by sentiment,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\" watch now VIDEO11:3711:37 Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king?

The pain may not be over International Digital Originals The collapse of FTX, once a $32 billion crypto exchange, has shattered investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. Market players are trying to gauge the extent of damage it has caused \u2014 and how it will reshape the industry in the years to come. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's former boss who stepped down on Nov. 11, was arrested in the Bahamas last week. He has been charged by the U.S. government with wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. FTX connected buyers and sellers of digital currencies like bitcoin, as well as derivatives. However, the company did more than that, allegedly dipping into client accounts to make risky trades through its sister firm Alameda Research. \"It's hugely disappointing for investors, or more so devastating for investors,\" said Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law who specializing in crypto-asset recovery and fraud. It's clear the FTX drama could radically reshape crypto in the years to come. Here are three big ways the industry could change. 1. Regulation For one, the disaster will looks certain to stir regulators into action. Crypto as an industry is still largely unregulated, meaning investors don't have the same protections they would have placing their funds with a licensed bank or broker. That may be about to change. Governments in the U.S., European Union and the U.K. are taking steps to clean up the market. If there's no regulation, the investors are left without that protection that they need. Louise Abbott Partner, Keystone Law The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets is the most comprehensive regulatory framework to date. It aims to reduce the risks for consumers buying crypto, making exchanges liable if they lose investors' assets. But MICA is not due to start until 12 months from now. Keystone Law's Abbott said it's important that regulators act quickly. \"People need to see that there's steps being taken to regulate it. And I think If we are able to offer some regulation, we will build confidence,\" she said. \"If there's no regulation, the investors are left without that protection that they need.\" Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC Pro This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia? Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside The saga has set back adoption of crypto assets by \"one or two years,\" according to Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute. \"Everything that failed this year, if you look at Celsius, Three Arrows, FTX now \u2014 all those guys were taking the worst of both worlds because they were not completely decentralized, and they were not properly centralized either,\" he said. For Kevin de Patoul, CEO of crypto market maker Keyrock, the biggest lesson from FTX's bankruptcy is that \"you cannot have complete centralization and lack of oversight.\" \"We are evolving to a world where you are going to have both centralization and decentralization,\" he said. \"When you do have that centralization, you need to have proper oversight and a proper balance of power.\" 2. Consolidation Many new companies and projects emerged in the years that followed the 2018 crypto winter \u2014 FTX among them. The expectation now is that fewer firms and coins will exist in the years to come. Contagion from the FTX saga is already playing out. Crypto lender BlockFi, which earlier sought financial assistance from FTX, has entered bankruptcy. Now, attention is turning to other trading and lending firms, like Gemini and Genesis. I don't think all the dominoes have fallen out from the contagion. The impact that this will have is that a lot of projects actually are not going to have the funds... Marieke Flament CEO, Near Foundation \"The challenge for the whole space when you think about contagion is that FTX and Alameda were extremely active investors in this space,\" Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.com, said in a CNBC-moderated talk at a crypto conference in London. Near Foundation, which is behind a blockchain network called Near, was among the firms that took investment from FTX. Marieke Flament, Near's CEO, said the firm had limited exposure to FTX \u2014 though the collapse was still \"a surprise and a shock.\" \"I don't think all the dominoes have fallen out from the contagion,\" Flament said. \"The impact that this will have is that a lot of projects actually are not going to have the funds, and therefore the resources, for them to continue and develop.\" VIDEO17:1817:18 Watch CNBC's full interview with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Squawk Box Fears have risen over the financial health of other major crypto exchanges after FTX's failure. Since early 2020, about 900,000 bitcoins have flowed out of exchanges, according to data from CryptoQuant. Binance, the world's largest exchange, is facing questions about the reserves it holds to backstop customer funds. The company saw billions of dollars in outflows in the past week. Currently, there is no reason to suspect Binance faces any risk of bankruptcy. But exchanges like Binance and Coinbase face a bleak market backdrop ahead amid falling trading volumes and account balances. Experts believe they'll continue to play a role \u2014 though their survival will be determined by how seriously they take risk management, governance and regulation. \"There will be exchanges that are doing things the right way and that will survive,\" said Abbott. Loading chart... As for tokens \u2014 bitcoin, being the longest-living digital currency, may be better positioned than its smaller rivals. \"My bet would be that bitcoin and DeFi [decentralized finance] are decoupled from the rest of crypto and actually start to have a life of its own,\" Gaevoy from Wintermute told CNBC. 3. Innovation Despite the depressed state of crypto markets, and the toll it's taken on investors, the digital asset industry is likely to pull through. Proponents of \"Web3,\" a hypothetical blockchain-based internet, expect 2022's crypto winter to pave the way for more innovative uses of blockchain, rather than the speculative uses crypto is associated with today. \"What we're seeing a lot is companies having digital innovation arms or metaverse innovation arms,\" Flament said. \"They understand that the technology is here. It's not going to go away.\" NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, could alter users' relationships with properties in games and events, for example. These are digital assets that track ownership of unique virtual items on the blockchain. watch now VIDEO9:0909:09 Crypto enthusiasts want to remake the internet with 'Web3.' Here's what it means Crypto \"Digital assets will be an increasing part of our lives, whether that is a collectible, a ticket, value, identity,\" Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at crypto wallet firm Ledger, told CNBC. \"Identity could be membership ... [people] using NFTs they own to get access to a particular event or something like that.\" But for many, there's still a learning curve to overcome. \"It's hard creating wallets and storing keys and going through different platforms,\" Cordel Robbin-Coker, CEO of mobile games firm Carry1st, told CNBC at the Slush startup conference in Helsinki, Finland. Robbin-Coker compared Web3 today with the internet in the early 90s. \"It was clunky. You had dial-up, it took four minutes to get on, the original web browsers were not very intuitive,\" he said. \"It's really the early adopters that really engage at that stage. But over time, companies build smoother interfaces. And they cut steps out of it.\""

        "detailedArticleContent": "watch now VIDEO0:5900:59 French startup Ledger launches new hardware crypto wallet Ledger Stax International Digital Originals The creator of the iPod, Tony Fadell, designed a new hardware wallet for people to store their cryptocurrency. The product, created by French crypto asset security firm Ledger, launched at the company's annual Ledger Op3n event Tuesday. Its launch comes at a time when trust in centralized crypto platforms is fading as a result of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX. It's called Ledger Stax and resembles a small smartphone or credit card reader. Measuring 85 millimeters long and 54 millimeters wide, it's roughly the same size as a credit card. It is also about 45 grams, weighing less than an iPhone. Users can deposit or exchange a range of tokens, including bitcoin, ether, cardano, solana and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The Ledger Stax sports a black-and-white E-ink display, similar to that of Amazon's Kindle e-readers. It also includes magnets, so that multiple devices can be stacked on top of each other, like a pile of books or cash \u2014 hence the name Stax. Users can connect it to their laptop through a USB cable or their phone via Bluetooth. \"Many Ledger owners have multiple devices, some store their NFTs, some store different crypto, some have multiple because they have different clients that they store for,\" Fadell told CNBC in an interview. The display also has a spine that curves around the edge, \"so you can see what's on each one, just like an old CD or cassette tape or book,\" he said. The iPod for crypto? Initially, Fadell turned down working with the Ledger team on Stax. \"This was not something I wanted to do,\" he said. \"When they first approached me I'm like, 'I don't want to do it. No thank you.' I was interested in crypto, I had crypto at the time but I've basically got a lot of other things to do.\" The Ledger Stax is the latest hardware crypto wallet from French startup Ledger. It's roughly the same size as a credit card and sports an E-ink display. Fadell later went on to purchase a few older Ledger devices. He found that, like MP3 players in 1999, people didn't know what to make of the devices. They were also difficult to use, he said. \"It didn't feel like it was ready for mass consumer, or at least early adopter consumer markets,\" said Fadell. \"Not just business to geeks, we had to go to business to consumer.\" The tech design guru \u2014 who previously co-founded the Nest smart thermostat before it was acquired by Google in 2014 \u2014 then decided to help the Ledger team. \"This reminds me a lot of the iPod,\" he said. The Ledger Stax, which retails at $279, is available for preorder starting Tuesday and will start shipping in the first quarter of 2023, Ledger said. It's not the first time a company has tried launching a smartphone focused on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. In 2018, during the last so-called \"crypto winter,\" HTC launched the Exodus 1, a mid-range phone with a crypto wallet included. Swiss startup Sirin Labs launched its own phone with a \"cold\" wallet, called Finney. And blockchain platform Solana this year debuted its own Android phone for \"Web3,\" named Saga. Such devices have largely struggled to gain any traction with consumers. watch now VIDEO9:2409:24 What is DeFi, and could it upend finance as we know it? Crypto Ian Rogers, Ledger's chief experience officer and a former executive at Apple and LVMH, said he's confident about the mass market potential. \"There's no question about the need for security and there's no question that we lead increasingly online lives,\" he told CNBC. \"Instagram, Nike, Starbucks, Amazon \u2014 many companies are finding real life use cases for digital assets. And so I think that we will grow with that.\" Not your keys, not your crypto After the recent collapse of FTX into insolvency, crypto holders have sought alternative means of storing their digital assets. One is via cold storage, where a user's private key \u2014 the code they need to access their account \u2014 is kept on a device that's not connected to the internet. Since these wallets are offline, they're less susceptible to hacks or failures. Ledger says that, to date, none of its devices have been hacked. Ledger has seen a boost in sales as a result of fears around the contagion from the FTX collapse. Last week, BlockFi, a crypto lender, entered bankruptcy after revealing Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's trading firm, defaulted on $680 million worth of loans from the company. November \"will be our all-time high biggest month ever,\" Pascal Gauthier, Ledger's CEO, told CNBC. \"All the news that you've seen since the beginning of the year, from Celsius all the way to FTX, has really pushed a lot of users towards self custody.\" Ledger has sold more than 5 million devices to date. However, a sharp downturn in digital asset prices could spell trouble for the company with retail investors becoming more wary. Only 21% of Americans feel comfortable investing in cryptocurrency, according to Bankrate's September survey. That's down from 35% in 2021. The Ledger Stax will compete with a slew of consumer gadgets this holiday shopping season, including Apple's new iPhone 14, at a time when budgets are being constrained by rising inflation."

        "detailedArticleContent": "FTX filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. on Nov. 11, 2022, seeking court protection as it looks for a way to return money to users. Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images Hackers who stole around $477 million worth of cryptocurrency from collapsed exchange FTX have started to launder the funds into bitcoin. This month, after FTX filed for bankruptcy, new CEO John Ray III said that \"unauthorized access to certain assets has occurred.\" Blockchain analytics company Elliptic estimates that around $477 million worth of cryptocurrency had been stolen from FTX. The theft adds insult to injury to FTX, a once $32 billion crypto empire who collapse has sent shockwaves across the industry. The stolen money has been converted into different digital coins but the bulk of it \u2014 more than $280 million \u2014 was changed into the cryptocurrency ether, according to public blockchain records of the account linked to the hackers. watch now VIDEO2:1002:10 First FTX-centered congressional hearing scheduled for December TechCheck Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, told CNBC that the hackers were converting the ether into a crypto product called RenBTC which is then being converted into bitcoin via a bridge. This allows one crypto to be converted into another without going through a centralized exchange. \"This is a common tactic in the laundering of crypto thefts,\" Robinson said. Elliptic researchers have documented how RenBridge has been used to launder \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars in cryptocurrency suspected of being sourced from ransomware attacks or hacks. Some of those hacks have connections to Russian-backed ransomware groups, according to Elliptic. So far, $74 million has been moved to bitcoin from RenBTC using RenBridge. Alameda, a trading firm and sister company to FTX, acquired RenBridge in 2021 as part of FTX's broader efforts to build out Solana and Serum. Serum is a \"decentralized exchange,\" with a Serum token running natively on Solana, promising users faster settlement and execution times. FTX and Alameda were large backers of the project, which was forked in an attempt to prevent FTX control following the bankruptcy. On Nov. 11, FTX users noted unusual transfers of cryptocurrency, sparking fears that FTX's platform had been compromised. Posts in FTX's Telegram thread indicated that the app and platform had in fact been infiltrated and compromised. Further allegations that Bankman-Fried worked with the regulators in the Bahamas to move crypto out of FTX wallets came after a Vox interview \u2014 which Bankman-Fried would later claim he understood as a casual conversation with a reporter friend \u2014 in which the ex-CEO of FTX pinned the suspected theft of FTX crypto on a disgruntled employee. FTX filings said they discovered the Bahamian transfers while investigating the weekend crypto theft. What those filings left unanswered was if those two were one and the same, or two separate occurrences. It is yet unclear how much the assets that Bahamian regulators took into custody are worth. CNBC reported on an emergency court filing by FTX on Nov. 18 to stop further action by the Bahamas regulators. FTX filings alleged that Bankman-Fried was possibly working in concert with those regulators. Hackers are some point will want to cash that money out into fiat. However, Robinson said that will be \"challenging\" due to the \"traceability of crypto.\" He said that he expects the hackers to use \"mixers to cover their blockchain trail.\" Mixers are services or software that allow a crypto transaction trail to be obfuscated on the blockchain, making it difficult or impossible to trace these funds, Robinson said. \"This may be one of the motivations behind moving these assets to bitcoin \u2014 the greater availability of mixing services,\" he added. The blockchain is a public ledger of crypto activity. Each coin may have its own blockchain. That makes it possible to trace, to an extent, where funds are moving. The use of mixers could make this difficult. Crypto compliance software company Chainalysis in a tweet on Sunday also confirmed that hackers are moving funds. FTX on Sunday urged cryptocurrency exchanges to keep an eye out for the stolen funds if the hackers try to process the money via one of their services. \"Exchanges should take all measures to secure these funds to be returned to the bankruptcy estate,\" FTX said in another tweet. FTX owes its largest creditors some $3.1 billion, according to court filings. Put another way, the hacked money is about 15% of what FTX owes its biggest clients alone. Bankman-Fried once oversaw a sprawling crypto empire that spanned every inhabited continent and claimed billions in assets. The implosion of FTX has left Bankman-Fried a paper pauper and investors left unable to access their crypto assets."

But one overvalued tech bet he never liked was bankrupt crypto trading firm FTX, which collapsed spectacularly from a $32 billion valuation to a bankruptcy filing and criminal investigations amid allegations of misuse of customer assets. \"We looked at investment twice, and passed both times,\" Mnuchin said at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York on Tuesday. Mnuchin, who has managed private equity investments since leaving the Trump administration, stressed that his decision was unrelated to current allegations that FTX misused customer funds, which he described as \"concerning\" but said he first learned about in the press. \"There's lots that needs to be understood and I am just watching outside now. I did not expect it would unwind nearly as quickly, and if indeed customer funds were misused those are very serious issues,\" he said. Mnuchin did not want to get into details related to his decision-making on FTX in an interview at the TEC Summit with CNBC's Melissa Lee, but did say that the second time he passed on making an investment, the crypto trading firm was \"five times the valuation\" it had been before. \"We were a bit surprised by the overall level of valuation,\" Mnuchin said. Last week, venture capital firm Sequoia marked down its investment in FTX to zero, among the major institutional investors caught up in the collapse. Mnuchin said top investors getting caught up in the fear of missing out hype cycle is nothing new. \"We've seen in a lot of tech companies where we had very smart investors invested at ridiculous valuations,\" he said. In the recent bull market, that FOMO spread well beyond crypto. \"You had people doing an investment a day in tech,\" Mnuchin said at the CNBC event. \"I just don't see how you can do 300 investments a year and think you can do due diligence on them and pick winners from losers,\" he said. \"Valuations reflected everything being perfect in the world.\" But now, he added, \"it's a much better environment for investing.\" The former Treasury Secretary believes that we have seen the peak in inflation and the Fed rate-hiking cycle may end a little lower, at 4.5%, than the market's worst-case scenario. Those rate hikes will still take some time to work their way through the economy and contribute to some more potential downside in the markets, but the correction in equities and tech stocks has been a healthy thing, Mnuchin said, whose private equity firm Liberty Strategic Capital has a focus on technology investments. Mnuchin, who once held a top tech post at Goldman Sachs, remains a believer and investor in the underlying blockchain technology, which he said has interesting applications. \"We've been more focused on the infrastructure side of crypto than the assets and trading side of the business,\" he said. He also thinks there is a middle ground on regulation to be struck in the wake of the FTX implosion. \"The problem is there needs to be more clarity on regulation,\" he said, pointing to a current U.S. approach which delegates regulatory authority among entities including the CFTC, FTC, the SEC and the Treasury \u2014 where he focused on crypto market transparency and money laundering. He also pointed to the offshore entities involved in the FTX situation, and said while it had a U.S. company, crypto remains an industry where \"people move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction\" in a game of \"regulatory arbitrage.\" The most important outcome, Mnuchin said, is that the U.S. does not go from one extreme to another, from a lack of regulation to over-regulation. \"There are very important innovations in this industry,\" he said. Though he added that the allegations of misuse of customer funds in the FTX case do point to a foundational principal in financial regulation. \"We need to have segregation of customer funds. It's one of the fundamental premises we rely upon,\" Mnuchin said. watch now VIDEO5:3905:39 SEC Chair Gary Gensler on FTX fallout: Investors need better protections in crypto Squawk Box"

Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images Some FTX users appear to have found a way to move money off of the exchange through a back door in the Bahamas. Analysis by data firm Argus found unusual trading patterns over the past five days as FTX was gating customer withdrawals. Most irregularities had to do with digital collectibles, known as NFTs. The patterns suggest \"desperate\" customers were turning to FTX users in the Bahamas for help, according to Argus. The now-bankrupt global cryptocurrency exchange is only allowing withdrawals in the Bahamas after halting FTX liquidations everywhere else in the world. The once $32 billion firm, partially based in Nassau, said in a tweet said it had to facilitate Bahamian withdrawals to comply with local regulations. High-net-worth users are paying astronomical prices for NFTs on FTX at a time when the broader crypto and digital collectible market has nosedived. In one case, a collectible that traded near $9 three weeks ago sold for $10 million on Friday. Another NFT that was similarly priced a month ago, sold for $888,888.88 this week. \"This NFT activity is highly irregular at a macro level when the NFT market overall is declining, both in value and in volume, and in this specific case when there is limited trading on other FTX markets,\" said Owen Rapaport, cofounder and CEO of Argus, a blockchain analytics company that specializes in insider trading.

One likely possibility, according to Rapaport, is that traders have an agreement with the Bahamian users to pay some percentage of the assets, and in return receive them once they've been successfully withdrawn from FTX. Elsewhere, trading volumes for nonfungible tokens have dropped 97% from their record high, according to data from Dune Analytics. The price of bitcoin is down 75% from its all-time high a year ago. These trades are visible on the blockchain, which acts as a public ledger for tracking the movement of money. While anyone can see where the money moves, identities are still anonymous. Argus could not say for certain who these customers were and that FTX appeared to have shut down the irregular trading on Friday. There are still \"bids\" or offers to buy these now pricey collectibles, but no buy orders have been executed since. FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Some Twitter users have called out similar irregularities this week. A popular crypto podcast host, who goes by Cobie, was among the first to suggest users were purchasing NFTs that are put up for sale by Bahamian users. He pointed to one wallet withdrawing $21 million worth of the cryptocurrency Tether from FTX, and sending it to an address that appeared to be based in the Bahamas. FTX has reportedly seen mysterious outflows after filing for bankruptcy protection. Reuters reported early Saturday that between $1 billion and $2 billion in customer funds had \"vanished\" from the exchange, citing two people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, data firm Elliptic estimates that $473 million has been moved off of FTX in a suspected hack. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday after a week of turmoil. The exchange, run by 30-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried, has been accused of misusing customer funds and was close to being bought by its biggest rival after a liquidity crisis."

According to Smith, the rapid downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried's company will accelerate a trend back towards regulated crypto institutions as well as a shift back towards individuals holding crypto assets on their own private keys. \"Crypto is one of the very few assets in the world that you can custody yourself, and I think we're going to see folks increasingly move back to that model as well as move to a model of trusting regulated companies in the space,\" Smith said.

Many blockchain projects and other crypto protocols have the potential to make financial services more efficient, accessible and affordable. But without proper precautions, they could also expose customers to cybersecurity risks. In recent months, many crypto investors have been struck by hacks and scams. For example, crypto exchange Binance was hit by a $570 million hack in October and Deribit lost $28 million in a hot wallet hack this month. \"What a bank needs to do from a regulatory point of view and customer's point of view is that we need to protect our customers. We cannot lose their money,\" Farooq said during a panel at the Singapore Fintech Festival 2022 on Wedneday. \"I do think you need some sort of identity solution or know-your-customer solution which verifies who the human being that is interacting is and what they are allowed to do. Because without that, in the longer term, it just doesn't work,\" he added in an interview with CNBC.

When the customer goes to a protocol to trade, the protocol validates the credential. \"I can't foresee people being able to send money across borders if no one checks and no one knows who's sending money to who, because sooner or later they will be in a money laundering incident,\" said Farooq. \"So those are the very fundamental things that need to be addressed before you even get to systematic issues. Education, protection and identity need to be in place,\" he added.

It allows financial transactions such as borrowing and lending to be performed autonomously on a blockchain without the need for intermediaries. \"It was the first time we had tokenized deposits. I actually think it's the first time any bank in the world has tokenized wallets on a public blockchain,\" Farooq told CNBC in an interview. \"Using public blockchain, we had to spend a lot of time thinking through identity.

Source: Dapper Labs Dapper Labs, the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) company known for creating collectible moments around NBA and NFL highlights, is laying off 22% of its company, according to an memo from its CEO. The Vancouver-based company, which ranked No. 9 on the 2022 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, is the latest blockchain- and web3-focused company that has gone through layoffs amid the ongoing 'crypto winter' that has seen the prices of nearly all digital assets plummet. More broadly, technology companies have been announcing layoffs and hiring freezes while moving to cut costs amid a worsening economic outlook, with venture-backed fintech companies Stripe and Chime also announcing staff cuts this week. Netflix, Spotify, Coinbase and Shopify have previously announced layoffs, while Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta have also looked to reduce expenses through slowing hiring or reducing headcount. \"We know web3 and crypto is the future across a multitude of industries \u2014 with 1000x potential from here in terms of mainstream adoption and impact \u2014 but today's macroeconomic environment means we aren't in full control of the timing,\" Dapper Labs Founder and CEO Roham Gharegozlou wrote in a message to employees on Wednesday night. Dapper Labs had more than 600 employees before the layoffs, Gharegozlou wrote. The company will be \"doubling down on what will move the needle and get the whole industry to its next inflection point \u2014 and pulling back on everything that doesn't fit that focus,\" he wrote. A spokesperson for Dapper Labs confirmed the memo.

Each of the highlights, which it calls moments, is licensed by the NBA, which receives royalties on each transaction. It surged in popularity in early 2021, with more than $224 million in sales occurring on the platform across over 1.3 million transactions in March 2021 which came alongside the peak of interest in NFTs more broadly, according to NFT data aggregator CryptoSlam. That helped Dapper Labs raise $250 million in a September 2021 funding round led by Coatue, which valued the company at $7.6 billion. In total, the company has raised more than $650 million and has an investor table that includes venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, and Google Ventures, as well as current and former NBA stars like Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Michael Jordan. In August, Dapper Labs launched a football-focused NFT platform with the NFL called NFL All Day, applying a similar formula to what it did with the NBA around its highlights. However, as broader interest in NFTs has fallen, so too has the popularity of Dapper Labs' platforms. In October, which coincided with the start of the 2022-2023 NBA season, there was $2.7 million in sales across the NBA Top Shot platform, down from $40.9 million from the previous year, a decline of 94%. The platform has seen four straight months of sales declines, and unique buyers totaled 13,462 in October, compared to 65,769 in October 2021. The NFL All Day market also saw a decline, with $6 million in volume in October down from $14 million in September. Dapper Labs also has a partnership with Endeavor-owned UFC and Spain's La Liga soccer league. Sports leagues and properties have embraced crypto-focused companies in recent years as a massive sponsorship category as well as a new way to reach fans, with no example being better than perhaps Crypto.com's 20-year, $700 million naming rights deal last year for the arena that houses the Los Angeles Lakers, Kings and Sparks. A February 2022 report from Nielsen projected that there would be $5 billion worth of blockchain and crypto firm sponsorships in sports by 2026. While there was seemingly a rush of deals alongside the rising prices of crypto, it has subsided as prices have cooled.

After getting some tips from law enforcement on who the hacker might be, Binance is now \"narrowing down\" the person or persons behind the attack, Zhao said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\" The attack in question saw a so-called cross-chain bridge targeted, allowing an as-yet unknown hacker or hackers to withdraw 2 million of Binance's BNB tokens worth around $570 million at the time. More than $1 billion has been lost to breaches on cross-chain bridges so far this year, tools that facilitate the swift transfer of tokens from one blockchain platform to another, according to Chainalysis data.

The \"vast majority of the funds remain under control,\" Binance's BNB Chain said in a statement at the time of the hack. About $100 million was unrecoverable, BNB Chain added. The BNB Chain, originally known as Binance Chain, was first developed by Binance in 2019.

The payments giant plans to announce a program Monday that will help financial institutions offer cryptocurrency trading, the company told CNBC. Mastercard will act as a \"bridge\" between Paxos, a crypto trading platform already used by PayPal to offer a similar service, and banks, according to the company. Mastercard and Paxos will handle regulatory compliance and security \u2014 two core reasons banks cite for avoiding the asset class. Some consumers have been skeptical, too. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are known for volatility, and the world's top digital assets have lost more than half of their value this year. The industry has suffered billions in hacks since January, coupled with multiple high-profile bankruptcies. Mastercard's chief digital officer said polling still shows demand for the asset, but roughly 60% of respondents said they would rather test the waters through their existing banks. \"There's a lot of consumers out there that are really interested in this, and intrigued by crypto, but would feel a lot more confident if those services were offered by their financial institutions,\" Mastercard's chief digital officer, Jorn Lambert, told CNBC in an interview. \"It's a little scary to some people still.\" Large investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have dedicated crypto teams but have largely avoided offering it to consumers.

While the industry is living through a bear market or \"crypto winter,\" Lambert said more activity down the road could lead to more transactions and fuel Mastercard's core business. \"It would be shortsighted to think that a little bit of a crypto winter heralds the end of it -- we don't see that,\" he said. \"As regulation comes in, there is going to be a higher degree of security available to the crypto platforms and we'll see a lot of the current issues getting resolved in the quarters in the years to come.\" Mastercard and Visa have both been on partnership sprees in crypto. Mastercard has already teamed up with Coinbase on NFTs and Bakkt to let banks and merchants in its network offer crypto-related services. Last week, Visa partnered with FTX to offer crypto debit cards in 40 countries and has more than 70 crypto partnerships. American Express has said it's exploring using its cards and network with stablecoins, which are pegged to the price of a dollar or another fiat currency. Cryptocurrencies, ironically, were meant to disrupt banks and middlemen like Mastercard and Visa. Their underlying technology, blockchain, allows transactions to move without intermediaries. Still, Lambert said they haven't seen industry pushback on their involvement. Crypto is on the \"cusp of really going mainstream,\" and still needs to team up with the incumbent players to get there, he said. \"It's hard to believe that the crypto industry will truly go mainstream without embracing the financial industry as we know it,\" Lambert said. watch now VIDEO9:2409:24 What is DeFi, and could it upend finance as we know it?

Matt Cardy | Getty Images Visa is betting that crypto investors still want to spend their digital currencies, even as prices plummet this year. The payments giant is teaming up with global exchange FTX to offer debit cards in 40 countries with a focus on Latin America, Asia and Europe. The cards, which are already available in the U.S., will link directly to a user's FTX cryptocurrency investing account. The move allows customers to spend digital currencies without moving those off an exchange, \"like you would with any bank account,\" according to Visa's CFO. \"Even though values have come down there's still steady interest in crypto,\" Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu told CNBC in a phone interview. \"We don't have a position as a company on what the value of cryptocurrency should be, or whether it's a good thing in the long run -- as long as people have things they want to buy, we want to facilitate it.\" The deal comes as the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been cut in half from their all-time highs in November. Bitcoin was trading near $20,000 as of Friday morning, down 57% since January. It's Visa's latest foray into the space and adds to more than 70 crypto partnerships. The San Francisco-based company has already joined forces with FTX's competitors Coinbase and Binance. Rival Mastercard has been on a similar spree, also partnering with Coinbase on NFTs and Bakkt to let banks and merchants in its network offer crypto-related services. American Express has said it's exploring using its cards and network with stablecoins, which are pegged to the price of a dollar or another fiat currency. But the CEO said earlier this year that consumers should not expect to see an AmEx crypto-linked card \"anytime soon.\" Unlikely teammates FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledged some irony in these partnerships. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were first designed to get around banks and intermediaries. But banks and payment companies are suddenly embracing the technology as cryptocurrencies go mainstream, and help drive payment volume. \"It's a technology that we absolutely see disrupting traditional payment networks,\" Bankman-Fried told CNBC in a phone call. \"There's a decision you have to make as a traditional payments company: do you want to lean into this or do you want to fight against it? I respect the fact that many of them are leaning into it.\" Bankman-Fried also said enabling card payments was key to the market's growth beyond being a speculative asset, or to some, a store of value. The Visa partnership makes it easier for merchants to accept cryptocurrencies without setting up proprietary technology. Visa and FTX convert it on the back end. As Prabhu put it \"everything is done behind the scenes.\" Both executives said the biggest opportunity is in emerging markets, where currency volatility and inflation make access to digital assets more attractive than they might look in the U.S. Bankman-Fried called out Turkey and Argentina, where inflation has topped 83% and 78%, respectively. \"Many of these things like are potentially cool and valuable in the United States but more so when you look globally,\" Bankman-Fried said. \"That's where you'll find places with really poor alternatives for payment rails and huge demand for something better.\" Visa's Prabhu pointed to demand for stablecoins, which are either linked to the price of a dollar or another fiat currency. The CFO said they often see people opening accounts to hold crypto \"and use those like they would a bank account.\" Despite mainstream adoption and Fortune 500 companies like Visa embracing the technology, the industry has had some high-profile blowups this year. Lenders Celsius and Voyager filed for bankruptcy after freezing withdrawals, and the failure of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital resulted in billions wiped out of the markets in a matter of days. Visa's CFO said so far, the company has been able to avoid exposure to a crypto crisis. \"Nothing is risk-free, you do the best you can \u2014 so far, the risk controls have worked well and our due diligence has worked well,\" Prabhu said. \"By and large we've been enabling innovation while protecting the Visa brand.\""

Craig Barritt | Getty Images Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto conglomerate FTX is in talks with investors to raise up to $1 billion in new funding that would keep the company's valuation at roughly $32 billion, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Negotiations are ongoing and the terms could change, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the talks are confidential. Coindesk previously reported on a coming investment at flat valuation, following FTX's last capital raise in January. Existing investors include Singapore's Temasek, SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global. An FTX spokesperson declined to comment. While its rivals and peers have been pummeled in this year's \"crypto winter,\" FTX has tried to bill itself as the market consolidator, swooping in to buy distressed assets at a discount. The company, which is based in the Bahamas, is privately held so it hasn't suffered the stock meltdown of Coinbase, which has lost three-quarters of its value in 2022. Some of the fresh capital, on top of the $400 million round from January, would go to fuel more deal-making, the sources said. In July, FTX signed a deal that gives it the option to buy lender BlockFi, and the company was in discussions to acquire South Korean Bithumb. FTX also offered to buy bankrupt crypto brokerage Voyager Digital in August but was turned down for what was called a \"low ball bid.\" Bloomberg reported in June that FTX was also trying to buy Robinhood, though Bankman-Fried, who owns a significant stake in the online broker, has denied any active discussions are underway. FTX's revenue soared more than 1,000% in 2021 to $1.02 billion from $89 million the prior year, CNBC reported last month, based on a leaked investor deck. FTX saw net income of $388 million last year, up from just $17 million a year earlier. Momentum continued in the first quarter, as the company reeled in $270 million in revenue, the financials showed. But that's when the market was soaring. Everything tied to crypto turned south in the second quarter, as rising interest rates and a four-decade high in inflation pushed investors out of the riskiest assets. Since the end of March, bitcoin and ether are both down by more than 60%, and numerous crypto-focused brokerages have been forced to liquidate. Bankman-Fried, a former Wall Street quant trader, founded FTX three years ago. In continuing to raise money and snap up assets, Bankman-Fried is wagering that crypto will rebound and that he'll be poised to capture a big chunk of profits when it does.

        "detailedArticleContent": "watch now VIDEO24:4924:49 How I became a crypto billionaire in 5 years Digital Original FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been shopping for bargains amid the industry's recent carnage and said he still has cash to spend if opportunity knocks. It may seem strange. Other multibillion-dollar crypto giants spiraled into bankruptcy this year. FTX's main competitor, Coinbase, has seen its shares plunge 70% and has laid off a fifth of its workforce as crypto prices crashed. Yet, FTX is somehow emerging as an industry lifeline. The 30-year-old billionaire says it was a result of stashing away ample cash, keeping overhead low, avoiding lending and being able to move quickly as a private company. \"It was important that the industry get through this in one piece,\" Bankman-Fried told CNBC in an interview at FTX headquarters in Nassau, Bahamas. \"It's not going to be good for anyone long term if we have real pain and real blowouts \u2014 it's not fair to customers and it's not going to be good for regulation.\" The crypto industry saw billions of dollars wiped out during the weeks surrounding the implosion of cryptocurrency Terra USD and the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Lenders with exposure to Three Arrows were the next domino to fall. In July, FTX signed a deal that gives it the option to buy lender BlockFi after providing a $250 million line of credit. FTX also extended $500 million to struggling Voyager Digital, which later declared bankruptcy, and was in discussions to acquire South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has lost more than half its value this year. 'Not immune' While Bankman-Fried's cryptocurrency exchange FTX is suffering from the downturn in digital assets, he said market share growth helped offset the pain. \"I don't think we're immune from it,\" Bankman-Fried said. \"But we put a lot of work in to growing our footprint over the last year ... and we have a less retail-heavy platform \u2014 retail tends to be more market sentiment dependent.\" Most of FTX's volume comes from customers trading \"at least\" $100,000 per day, he said. Bankman-Fried described the group as \"highly engaged, high volume\" users that are \"fairly sophisticated.\" It ranges from small quant trading firms to family offices and day traders. FTX's demographic has been less price sensitive and held up relatively well in crypto's bear market, according to the company. watch now VIDEO9:0909:09 Crypto enthusiasts want to remake the internet with 'Web3.' Here's what it means Crypto In addition to its success with professional traders, it's making an expensive land grab for the U.S. retail trading audience. FTX bought the the naming rights to the Miami Heat's NBA arena, formerly American Airlines Center. It has courted high-profile investors and brand ambassadors including Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen, and ran a Super Bowl ad featuring Larry David. The cryptocurrency exchange brought in roughly a billion dollars in revenue last year, CNBC reported in August. Bankman-Fried confirmed the numbers were in the \"right ballpark\" and this year would see a \"similar\" figure, depending on how severe the market slowdown is. He also said the company is profitable. He pointed to low employee head count as one factor accounting for profitability. FTX has roughly 350 employees -- about a tenth of Coinbase's workforce. \"We've always tried to grow in a sustainable way -- I've always been deeply suspicious of negative unit economics, any economics without any sort of real, clear pathway to profitability,\" he said. \"We hired a lot less than most places did but we've also kind of kept our costs under control.\" Loading chart... Bankman-Fried earned a degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and started his career as a quantitative trader at Jane Street Capital. He bought his first bitcoin five years ago, and said he was drawn to the industry by wide arbitrage opportunities that seemed \"too good to be true.\" In 2017, Bankman-Fried launched proprietary trading firm Alameda Research to start trading the asset full time. The firm was making a million dollars a day in some cases, buying on an exchange in one market, and selling back on other global exchanges, according to the CEO. Alameda Research still accounts for about 6% of FTX's exchange volumes, according to documents seen by CNBC. While Bankman-Fried is still a major shareholder in Alameda, he stepped down from day-to-day operations. Bankman-Fried said he's worked over the past few years to eliminate conflicts of interest at Alameda. \"I don't run Alameda anymore \u2014 none of FTX does. We view it as a neutral piece of market infrastructure.\" FTX has seen epic growth since Bankman-Fried launched it alongside co-founder Gary Wang in 2019. It last raised $400 million in January at a $32 billion valuation, bringing its total venture capital funding in the past three years to about $2 billion. FTX Trading Ltd. is headquartered in Antigua, with FTX Derivatives Markets based in the Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried lives. FTX Trading has acquired companies in Switzerland, Australia, Cyprus, Germany, Gibraltar, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, among other countries. The exchange has spent about half of its cash on bailouts and acquisitions, most recently buying a 30% stake in Anthony Scaramucci's Skybridge Capital. \"We still have a fair bit left to deploy, if and when it's useful or important,\" Bankman-Fried said. Three-day deals FTX benefited from being a private company this year. FTX doesn't have the daily ups and downs of a publicly traded stock, especially growth names, which this year have been battered by higher interest rates. Bankman-Fried also said not having thousands of shareholders enabled FTX to move quickly when trying to close deals in a matter of days. \"I do think it makes it a lot harder, practically speaking, to do this as a public company,\" he said. When \"you have three days from start to finish to wire the money, you can't do a public engagement process around the potential terms of a messy situation.\" Bankman-Fried said many of the deals were done in a matter of days, when the team \"didn't sleep much that week.\" What's often lengthy due diligence came instead in a truncated Excel spreadsheet. The finances weren't audited. The team had at least some expectation of losing money. watch now VIDEO12:5012:50 How Wall Street learned to love bitcoin Crypto \"It was unclear if it would be net positive or negative \u2014 there was potential upside in a case where things went well,\" he said. \"We got to the point of feeling like we could do something that would have a nontrivial chance of helping for an amount of money that we were willing to lose if things went wrong.\" It's too soon to tell if Bankman-Fried's distressed crypto bets will pay off. Some companies have said no to a rescue package altogether. After extending a line of credit to Voyager, FTX and Alameda looked to buy and and restructure the company. It outlined a plan to purchase Voyager's digital assets and loans at market value. The company responded to the bid calling it a \"low ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue.\" \"It surprised me. It didn't surprise our legal team,\" he said. \"I had honestly just assumed they'd see our offer and just say ... of course, we'll take this.\" Bankman-Fried said there were further discussions and the answers were \"disappointing.\" The problem, he said, was that the proposal didn't take any fees. \"If you're in the business of taking fees, then maybe our proposal isn't what you like,\" he said. \"I believe it was a lowball offer for consultants looking to make fees on this case. That's not who I had had in mind. I had the customers in mind. But that is my current best understanding about what happened.\" The next ... Warren Buffett? Bankman-Fried's latest moves in crypto have drawn comparisons with Warren Buffett's strategy in 2008. The legendary Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO stopped the bleeding during the financial crisis with a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs. That eventually brought the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate a $3 billion gain. \"There are some parallels,\" Bankman-Fried said. \"There are probably more differences. First of all, I don't think Warren Buffett would call me the next Warren Buffett. To the extent there is a parallel recently, it's been looking at which assets are in a place where they pretty badly need capital.\" Bankman-Fried said he's finding spots where he can \"simultaneously make good investments, and help backstop them and their customers and ecosystem.\" Although sometimes only one is on offer, not both. He also applauded Buffett's skill in long-term, value investing. The investor has showed that \"you don't need to have one brilliant innovation or insight, you can do it by just piecing together good decision after good decision over the course of decades and compounding that.\" watch now VIDEO8:1008:10 What you should know before investing in crypto International Digital Originals Like Buffett, Bankman-Fried signed the Giving Pledge: a promise by the world's wealthiest individuals to donate the majority of their wealth to charity. Bankman-Fried said he has given away roughly $100 million this year, with a focus on future pandemic prevention. Similar to Buffett, he lives modestly. Bankman-Fried shares a house with 10 roommates and a Goldendoodle named Gopher. He drives a Toyota Corolla, and said he has no interest in the excesses of a yacht or Lamborghini. But the two humble investors sharply diverge when it comes to their positions on cryptocurrencies. Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger have been critical of cryptocurrencies over the years. In 2018, for example, Buffett called bitcoin \"probably rat poison squared.\" Earlier this year, Buffett said he wouldn't buy all the bitcoin in the world for $25 because it \"doesn't produce anything.\" Buffett has called the underlying blockchain technology \"important\" \u2014 but hasn't wavered on the idea that \"bitcoin has no unique value at all.\" Blockchains are digital databases that store cryptocurrency transactions and, in some cases, other data. Its main use has been powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But fans of the technology say it could be used in health care, supply chain logistics and other areas of finance. \"I certainly disagree with that,\" Bankman-Fried said. \"I should hope [Buffett] disagrees with that, too. I don't think you should be running a company if he thinks that, but I don't think he actually thinks that. I think that was very likely hyperbole,\" he said. \"He's missed some of the power of blockchain \u2014 he's also missed some of the impetus for it in the first place, and what's driving people to want a new tool.\" Correction: Gisele Bundchen is a brand ambassador for FTX.

Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty Images Coinbase is footing the bill for a lawsuit filed against the Treasury Department Thursday by users of the recently sanctioned crypto service, Tornado Cash. The six plaintiffs include Coinbase employees and other users of the mixing service that was blacklisted by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August. Mixing services like Tornado Cash are used to obfuscate crypto transactions, which while anonymous, are easily traceable. The Treasury Department argued this particular service was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of digital currency in the past three years by North Korean hackers and other bad actors. But in some cases, mixing services are used for legitimate privacy reasons. One plaintiff, a senior security risk analyst at Coinbase, used the service to anonymize donations to Ukraine out of fear his address would be targeted by Russian hacking groups. Another had concerns about his family's security. \"Each is an American who simply wants to engage in entirely lawful activity in private,\" according to the lawsuit. The sanctions were a unique move by Treasury to blacklist open source software, versus an entity or person. Crypto enthusiasts have argued that the move was an overstep, sets a new legal precedent and could cause negative ripple effects for the tech industry. \"We saw this as a much larger problem,\" Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, told CNBC. \"It sets a dangerous precedent -- if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology any tool or system could be fair game.\" Grewal, former deputy general counsel at Facebook, said it could have a chilling effect on innovation. He likened the Tornado Cash scenario to police chasing armed robbers on a highway. In order to catch the criminals, \"we wouldn't ban all use of that highway.\" Grewal said it was the first time Coinbase has financially supported an external lawsuit and plans to pay for the plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as other costs associated with pursuing the claims in federal court. Thursday's suit argues that the move went a step beyond Treasury's authority, and as Coinbase put it in a blog post uses \"a hammer instead of a scalpel.\" The plaintiffs argue it caused financial harm as their money is still locked on Tornado Cash, and hurt users relying on the tools for privacy reasons. The case asks the Court to remove Tornado Cash smart contracts from the U.S. sanctions list. Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume and has publicly advocated for crypto reforms in Washington, while dealing with a series of recent SEC probes. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested information from Coinbase about the listing of cryptocurrencies that the agency argues may have been unregistered securities. The SEC is also looking into its crypto rewards program, known as staking. \"We have advocated for regulatory reform across Washington and that work will continue,\" Grewal said. \"We can continue to cooperate and partner with the agencies that are being challenged in this instance, because this is not about questioning anyone's good faith, but it is about assuring that the rule of law applies.\""

        "detailedArticleContent": "Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during an interview on an episode of Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug 17, 2022. Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty Images FTX rode the crypto craze to a billion dollars in revenue last year while expanding its global footprint through a flurry of acquisitions, according to internal documents seen by CNBC. The audited financials give a rare glimpse into the privately held company's finances. FTX was profitable, quickly expanding across the globe and saw breakneck growth. The crypto exchange's revenue soared more than 1,000% from $89 million to $1.02 billion in 2021. Its profitability, like many start-ups, depends on how you measure it. Operating income was $272 million, up from $14 million a year earlier. FTX saw net income of $388 million last year, up from just $17 million a year earlier. FTX declined to comment on the leaked financial documents. The company brought in $270 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022, and was on track to do roughly $1.1 billion in revenue in 2022, according to an investor deck shared with CNBC. But it's unclear how FTX held up in the second quarter as crypto prices plunged during the recent so-called \"Crypto Winter.\" By way of comparison, publicly traded Coinbase also experienced a cash boom during crypto's bull market, with $7.4 billion in revenue and $3.6 billion of net income last year. But in the second quarter of this year, it reported $808.3 million in revenue, a decline of 64% from the year-ago quarter, and a surprise net loss of $1.1 billion, compared with $1.59 billion in net income a year earlier, as retail trading volumes cratered. FTX was founded three years ago by former Wall Street quant trader Sam Bankman-Fried. The 30-year-old CEO has recently stepped in as the industry's lender of last resort, looking to backstop companies as liquidity dried up. On top of multiple loans of hundreds of millions of dollars, Bankman-Fried's companies also looked to acquire distressed assets. In July, FTX signed a deal that gives it the option to buy lender BlockFi and was in discussions to acquire South Korean Bithumb. FTX also offered to buy Voyager in August but was turned down for what the company claimed was a \"low ball bid.\" FTX had roughly $2.5 billion in cash at the end of last year and 27% profit margins, according to the documents. Margins were closer to 50% if advertising and \"related party\" expenses are stripped out. It last raised money in January, collecting $400 million from investors like SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, at a $32 billion valuation. Global footprint FTX was founded at a time when Coinbase and Binance had solidified themselves as the world's largest trading venues. Coinbase still operates largely within the U.S. Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume got its start in China, later moved its headquarters to the Cayman Islands and is now making a push for the U.S. market with an American subsidiary. FTX has been quietly building its own fleet of global subsidiaries to compete. FTX Trading Ltd. is headquartered in Antigua, with FTX Derivatives Markets based in the Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried lives. FTX Trading recently bought Digital Assets DA AG, out of Switzerland, as well as IFS Group and Hive out of Australia \u2013 bringing the total to 15 smaller companies across the world. Its portfolio companies span Cyprus, Germany, Gibraltar, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, among other countries, according to the documents. Crypto companies often acquire start-ups to quickly get the proper regulatory licenses to set up shop in a new country. Bankman-Fried also founded trading firm Alameda Research, which accounts for about 6% of FTX's exchange volumes, according to the documents. FTX's U.S. business is technically owned by a parent company, West Realm Shires Inc. As of 2021, FTX U.S. made up less than 5% of FTX's total revenue. Still, the company is making a push to expand in the U.S. with a series of high-profile ads and sponsorships. FTX spent roughly 15% of revenue on advertising and marketing in 2021, according to the documents. That may account for its 2022 Super Bowl ad with actor Larry David and high-profile celebrity endorsements by Tom Brady and Giselle Bündchen, who are also equity investors in the company. FTX also bought the naming rights to Miami's NBA arena, formerly the American Airlines Arena. FTX planned to spend an estimated $900 million in advertising in the coming years, according to the documents. The crypto exchange is also expanding into stock trading. It launched equities trading weeks after Bankman-Fried took a 7.6% passive stake in Robinhood, fueling speculation that FTX is looking to buy the trading app in a landgrab for U.S. retail accounts. Robinhood and Bankman-Fried have denied that a deal is in the works. FTX has certainly ramped up its retail expansion efforts. But the documents show that it's still mainly a venue for more sophisticated traders using derivatives \u2013 either futures, or options. About two-thirds of revenue came from futures trading fees, while roughly 16% came from so-called spot trading. Futures and derivatives trades tend to be more lucrative for exchanges."

Nicolas Economou | Nurphoto | Getty Images Bitcoin briefly topped $25,000 to hit its highest level in June before falling sharply as the cryptocurrency struggles to make any significant move higher. The world's largest digital coin popped above $25,000 late on Sunday for the first time since mid-June, according to CoinDesk data. It was flat on Monday at $24,120.61. Cryptocurrencies moved higher in the last month or so following a rise in U.S. stocks. Digital currencies like bitcoin have been relatively correlated to the movement in stock markets, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was itself up around 12% in the last month. Investors have been getting more bullish after economic data showed inflation pressures could be easing a bit. Bitcoin was up around 15% in the same period but it is still down around 48% year-to-date. It has been a rough few months for the crypto market, with trillions wiped off its value and bankruptcies and liquidity issues plaguing a number of players. The cryptocurrency has been trading in a range since late June of around $20,000 to $24,000. While it has shown attempts to push higher, it has struggled to create a significant breakout. But there are now signs of a small rally. \"BTC continues to show signs of bullishness mainly due to higher highs and lows being formed,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. Bitcoin's rise can also be attributed to a rally in alternative coins, or altcoins. Ether was up 56% in the last month, far outpacing the gains made by bitcoin. That's because investors are excited about a major long-awaited upgrade to the Ethereum network that could improve the efficiency of transactions. Ether is the native cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. The upgrade, known as the \"merge,\" ran its final dress rehearsal last week. That rally in ether is also feeding through to bitcoin. \"We're seeing BTC catch up with ETH, given the excitement over the merge, potentially scheduled for 15th September,\" Ayyar said."

And, he believes this week's key inflation data will help prove it. \"I don't see anything that will reduce the inflation rate. There are some things that might reduce prescription drug prices and maybe a couple of other things,\" the Bianco Research president told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Monday. \"But will that bring down CPI? Will that bring down core CPI to a point where we can actually start pricing that in? No, I don't think so.\" The government releases its Consumer Price Index [CPI], which tracks prices people pay for goods and services, for July this Wednesday. Dow Jones expects the number to come in at 8.7%, down 0.4% from June. The headline number includes energy and food, unlike Core CPI. On Thursday, the government releases its Producer Price Index [PPI]. Bianco contends peak inflation may still be ahead. \"Inflation is persistent. Is it going to stay 9.1%? Probably not. But it might settle down into a 4%, 5% or 6% range,\" he said. \"What does that mean? We're going to need a 5% or 6% funds rate, if that's where inflation is going to settle.\" There's no near-term solution, according to Bianco. As long as wage numbers come in hot, he warns inflation will continue to grip the economy. \"Wage inflation, from what we saw in the report on Friday, is at 5.2% [year-to-year], and it's looking pretty sticky there,\" Bianco said. \"If we have 5% wages, you can pay 5% inflation. So, it's not going to go much below wages. We need to get wages down to 2% in order to get inflation down to 2% and wages aren't moving right now.\" 'If you're not going to pay extra for that car, then you're going to have to walk' Bianco lists used car prices as a major example of relentless inflation. He believes high sticker prices won't meaningfully budge for months due to demand, supply chain issues and chip shortages forcing automakers to reduce features in new cars. \"If you're not going to pay extra for that car, then you're going to have to walk because that's the only way you're going to get a ride right now,\" said Bianco. According to the CarGurus index, the average price for a used car is $30,886, up 0.2% over the past 90 days and 10.5% year-over-year. \"Used car prices in the last 18 months have actually outperformed cryptocurrencies,\" he added .\"It's been one of the best investments that people can have.\" Bianco expects the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed by the Senate this weekend, would have a negligible impact if it's enacted. \"A lot of this stuff doesn't kick in for another couple of more years,\" Bianco said. \"In a world where we want to know what the Fed is going to do in September and when inflation is going to peak, those are '22, '23 stories. Those are going to continue to dominate the markets.\" The House is expected to vote Friday on the legislation. Disclaimer"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Bitcoin and ether ended Thursday in the red, but ether has surged more than 100% since mid-June. Yu Chun Christopher Wong | S3studio | Getty Images Hackers drained almost $200 million in cryptocurrency from Nomad, a tool that lets users swap tokens from one blockchain to another, in yet another attack highlighting weaknesses in the decentralized finance space. Nomad acknowledged the exploit in a tweet late Monday. \"We are aware of the incident involving the Nomad token bridge,\" the startup said. \"We are currently investigating and will provide updates when we have them.\" It's not entirely clear how the attack was orchestrated, or if Nomad plans to reimburse users who lost tokens in the attack. The company, which markets itself as a \"secure cross-chain messaging\" service, wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Blockchain security experts described the exploit as a \"free-for-all.\" Anyone with knowledge of the exploit and how it worked could seize on the flaw and withdraw an amount of tokens from Nomad \u2014 sort of like a cash machine spewing out money at the tap of a button. It started with an upgrade to Nomad's code. One part of the code was marked as valid whenever users decided to initiate a transfer, which allowed thieves to withdraw more assets than were deposited into the platform. Once other attackers cottoned on to what was going on, they deployed armies of bots to carry out copycat attacks. \"Without prior programming experience, any user could simply copy the original attackers' transaction call data and substitute the address with theirs to exploit the protocol,\" said Victor Young, founder and chief architect of crypto startup Analog. watch now VIDEO8:1808:18 How a $60 billion crypto collapse got regulators worried Crypto \"Unlike previous attacks, the Nomad hack became a free-for-all where multiple users started to drain the network by simply replaying the original attackers' transaction call data.\" Sam Sun, research partner at crypto-focused investment firm Paradigm, described the exploit as \"one of the most chaotic hacks that Web3 has ever seen\" \u2014 Web3 being a hypothetical future iteration of the internet built around blockchain technology. Nomad is what's known as a \"bridge,\" a tool that lets users exchange tokens and information between different crypto networks. They're used as an alternative to making transactions directly on a blockchain like Ethereum, which can charge users high processing fees when there's lots of activity happening at once. Instances of vulnerabilities and poor design have made bridges a prime target for hackers seeking to swindle investors out of millions. More than $1 billion in crypto assets has been stolen through bridge exploits so far in 2022, according to a report from crypto compliance firm Elliptic. In April, a blockchain bridge called Ronin was exploited in a $600 million crypto heist, which U.S. officials have since attributed to the North Korean state. Some months later, Harmony, another bridge, was drained of $100 million in a similar attack. Like Ronin and Harmony, Nomad was targeted through a flaw in its code \u2014 but there were a few differences. With those attacks, hackers were able to retrieve the private keys needed to gain control over the network and start moving out tokens. In Nomad's case, it was much simpler than that. A routine update to the bridge enabled users to forge transactions and make off with millions' worth of crypto."

        "detailedArticleContent": "watch now VIDEO4:5704:57 Major crypto lender files for bankruptcy, former employees say company plagued by mismanagement The News with Shepard Smith Problems at Celsius appear to have been simmering for years before the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy. The crypto company saw a range of internal missteps leading up to its recent turmoil, according to former employees and internal documents CNBC reviewed. Multiple employees painted a picture of risk-taking, disorganization and alleged market manipulation. \"The biggest issue was a failure of risk management,\" Timothy Cradle, Celsius' former director of financial crimes compliance, told CNBC in an interview. \"I think Celsius had a good idea, they were providing a service that people really needed, but they weren't managing risk very well.\" The Hoboken, New Jersey-based company made headlines a month ago after it froze customer accounts, blaming \"extreme market conditions.\" It had attracted 1.7 million customers and $11.8 billion in deposits as of June. Celsius customers have told CNBC they were drawn in by a 17% yield the company was offering on crypto deposits. Behind the scenes, Celsius would lend that money out to hedge funds and others willing to pay an even higher yield. It would also invest in other high-risk cryptocurrency projects, according to internal documents. Celsius would later split those profits with the customer. The model came crashing down along with the price of cryptocurrencies, which caused multiple companies to freeze assets and at least three to file for bankruptcy. Cradle said he was part of a three-person compliance team between 2019 and 2021. The role required him to apply international finance laws to Celsius' business. But resources were limited, he said. \"The compliance team was too small,\" Cradle said. \"Compliance was a cost center \u2014 basically we were sucking out money and not bringing any back in. They didn't want to spend on compliance.\" One of the internal company documents CNBC obtained echoed this claim. It said when it came to assessing fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms, \"there is not adequate compliance staff for the amount of users on Celsius's platform as there are only 3 full-time individuals.\" 'Banks are not your friends' Cradle said he was especially alarmed by conversations at a Celsius Christmas party in 2019 about a cryptocurrency created and used by Celsius, called the \"cel\" token. Executives said they were \"pumping up the cel token\" and \"actively trading and increasing the price of the token,\" Cradle said. \"They weren't shy about it. They were absolutely trading the token to manipulate the price,\" Cradle said. \"It came up in two completely different conversations for two completely different reasons.\" Celsius, CEO Alex Mashinsky and company lawyers did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Celsius on Thursday was sued by former investment manager Jason Stone, as pressure continues to mount on the firm amid a crash in cryptocurrency prices. Stone has alleged, among other things, that Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky (above) was \"able to enrich himself considerably.\" Piaras Ó Mídheach | Sportsfile for Web Summit | Getty Images Celsius was by far the largest holder of cel tokens. But it was also a buyer, according to blockchain data firm Arkham. The firm estimated that Celsius spent $350 million acquiring tokens on exchanges over the past three years, despite already having billions worth in its own treasury. At the same time, top executives were selling. Accounts associated with Alex Mashinsky appear to have sold or \"swapped\" roughly $40 million, according to Arkham. Cradle and other employees received part of their salary in cel tokens. A former human resources employee said it was a way to attract and retain talent. It also let them share in the company's financial upside \u2014 similar to the appeal of equity in a fast-growing start-up. The token started to spike in early 2020 and the following year hit a high of almost $8. It was trading under $1 as of July. Celsius' CEO was an outspoken booster of the token. He gave weekly YouTube updates often touting the benefits or \"tokenomics\" of the project. Mashinsky was also known to criticize Wall Street banks. He frequently wore a black T-shirt during public appearances that said: \"Banks are not your friends.\" Another former Celsius employee, who asked not to be named, said while Mashinsky was inducing average investors to buy the cryptocurrency, he was selling behind the scenes. It wouldn't take much to move the price of the token because the volume was relatively small, the former employee said. Mashinsky was selling millions behind closed doors without any public disclosures, according to the former employee. \"It's easy to manipulate the price of cel due to the low trading volumes in cel. I'm sure [Mashinsky] knows that,\" the former employee said. \"That's just an example of what he will do to publicly manipulate the price for his own benefit.\" The former employee's allegations echo a recent lawsuit brought by a former investment manager, Jason Stone. Stone alleges that Celsius artificially inflated the price of its own token and was \"actively using customer funds to manipulate crypto-asset markets to their benefit.\" The suit also claimed Celsius failed to hedge risk and engaged in activities that amounted to fraud. Details within internal documents Other internal documents shine light on some of the risk Celsius appeared to be taking with customer funds. Lenders such as Celsius and hedge funds were able to achieve high returns by investing in \"decentralized finance,\" or DeFi, projects. Celsius has its own cryptocurrency and relied on high yields to attract more borrowers. According to internal documents, Celsius was investing customer funds in multiple DeFi projects. All were labeled medium to high risk. On Wednesday, Vermont became the sixth state regulator to launch an investigation into Celsius and pointed to that investment strategy. The state's Department of Financial Regulation said Celsius \"deployed customer assets in a variety of risky and illiquid investments, trading, and lending activities.\" \"Celsius customers did not receive critical disclosures about its financial condition, investing activities, risk factors, and ability to repay its obligations to depositors and other creditors,\" the Vermont regulator said in a statement. Cradle also said that many Celsius users likely didn't have a good grasp of the company's terms of use, which contradicted the messaging that Celsius communicated through its marketing. But the risks associating with depositing funds with Celsius were \"hiding in plain sight,\" Cradle said. Section 13 of the company's terms of use says that once a customer deposits funds, the funds belong to Celsius. Cradle also said he saw evidence of the company trading customer funds without disclosing that it was doing so. Celsius' CEO has said explicitly on Twitter that the company did not trade customer funds. Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Twitter Cradle said that based on his firsthand experience with the company's risk appetite he wouldn't keep his own money with Celsius. \"I didn't feel comfortable leaving them on the platform,\" Cradle said, referring to his own crypto funds. \"I frequently read the terms of use \u2014 once you deposit your assets with Celsius, they belong to Celsius, and Celsius can keep them if they need to or want to.\" Internal documents also show evidence of disorganization across multiple teams. One document shows policies written by a team without the head of that team knowing. In one instance, a top risk officer writes that he was \"surprised\" by a document written by another team overseas. \"He was probably surprised that the document even existed \u2014 that's just the way things were at Celsius. It's left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing,\" Cradle said. \"It's just another example of mismanagement or sort of sloppy management on Celsius' part.\" Lacking transparency One area in which Cradle said Celsius lacked transparency was its number of accounts. While Celsius reported 1.7 million users, Cradle said that number is inflated. \"It's probably closer to 300,000, because the amount of fake accounts was so vast and there was nothing the management team was willing to do to really stop people from doing that,\" he said. In addition to this alleged discrepancy, Mashinsky's own Twitter posts show a contrast between the messages he conveyed to customers and what was transpiring behind the scenes. The day before the withdrawal freeze, in response to a tweet that questioned the company's financial health, Mashinsky wrote: \"do you even know one person who has a problem withdrawing from Celsius? why spread FUD and misinformation,\" referring to fear, uncertainty and doubt. The following day, June 12, customers were no longer permitted to withdraw funds from their accounts. Public records indicate Celsius may have had financial problems long before this. Data from the federal government shows Celsius received a Paycheck Protection Program loan worth $281,502 in April 2020. The federal government awarded these loans to businesses negatively affected by the Covid pandemic. \"That raised my eyebrows a bit, and I was curious if we were profitable,\" Cradle said. The loan was forgiven by the federal government, meaning that Celsius met the requirements needed to avoid repayment. Background checks Risk-taking also showed up in the Celsius hiring process. Nikki Goodstein, a former senior member of the human resources team, said she was not aware of any background checks at the company when she joined in May 2021. She told CNBC that executives specifically told the chief human resources officer not to run a background check on Yaron Shalem, the incoming chief financial officer. In November 2021, Shalem was arrested in Israel and charged with money laundering in connection with his previous company. Shalem did not respond to requests for comment. CNBC also made an attempt to find out the status of the case, but it does not appear to be publicly available in the Israeli court system. The chief human resources officer who Goodstein said was told not to run a background check did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Goodstein, who worked at publicly traded Fortune 500 companies before Celsius, said she was \"surprised\" someone in an executive role wouldn't face a background check. \"It was definitely a gap in process at that time,\" she said. \"Everyone was [upset] that he wasn't background checked, because then it wouldn't have brought such embarrassment to the company if that was a process that we had in place \u2014 we all were kind of like, what the heck just happened?\" Cradle said he's not planning to go back to the cryptocurrency industry after Celsius and a stint at another start-up. Celsius set out to make a good product at a time when banks paid near zero interest on savings, he said. \"I think it was good people with poor planning \u2014 they didn't hire at the right times, they didn't staff up at the right times, they didn't scale with the growth of the company,\" he said. \"It was just a bunch of mistakes that are ending up very tragically.\" \u2014 Érica Carnevalli and Margaret Fleming contributed to this article."

The world's largest cryptocurrency ended Monday at $21,610.59, up 2.76%, according to CoinMetrics. Bitcoin hit a high of $22,757.36, the highest level since June 16. Other cryptocurrencies also bounced, with ether up 8.94% at $1,466 by the end of the day Monday. The bullish sentiment was helped by a rally in stock markets in Europe and Asia. U.S. stock futures were also higher. Cryptocurrencies, in particularly bitcoin, has been closely correlated with equity market trade. Often, a rise in stocks will also lift sentiment in the crypto market. But investors are also watching whether the carnage over the last few weeks, which has seen bitcoin near 70% off its all-time high that was hit in November and billions of dollars wiped off the market, might be over. The price crash has brought the downfall of several high-profile companies in the space, most notably hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto lender Celsius, both of which have filed for bankruptcy. These collapses have caused contagion across the industry and seen other associated companies come under pressure. Much of this has been caused by the huge amounts of leverage and borrowing that has taken place in this latest crypto cycle. Three Arrows Capital for example took out loans it was unable to pay back once the crypto collapse took place. Celsius, which offered customers yields over 18% for depositing their digital coins, took on high risk trading activities to earn the interest to try to give back to its users. Crypto companies have been selling off whatever assets they have to try to meet their liabilities which has put pressure on the broader market. Analysts say there are signs this contagion could be slowing. \"The worst of market contagion has likely run its course, with the majority of forced selling behind us,\" David Moreno, research analyst at CryptoCompare, wrote in a research note. Despite the rally, the crypto market is still suffering. Both bitcoin and ether are down more than 50% this year. Bitcoin had its worst quarter in more than a decade in the second quarter. Analysts are still not convinced of any significant move higher in the near term. \"Given the severely negative performance in Q2, it is unsurprising that a 'relief' bounce has occurred. We believe the market will continue range-bound over the coming months,\" Moreno said."

        "detailedArticleContent": "Ethereum coin Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto | Getty Images Hackers have stolen $100 million in cryptocurrency from Horizon, a so-called blockchain bridge, in the latest major heist in the world of decentralized finance. Details of the attack are still slim, but Harmony, the developers behind Horizon, said they identified the theft Wednesday morning. Harmony singled out an individual account it believes to be the culprit. \"We have begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds,\" the start-up said in a tweet late Wednesday. In a follow-up tweet, Harmony said it's working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and multiple cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack. Blockchain bridges play a big role in the DeFi space, offering users a way of transferring their assets from one blockchain to another. In Horizon's case, users can send tokens from the Ethereum network to Binance Smart Chain. Harmony said the attack did not affect a separate bridge for bitcoin. Like other facets of DeFi, which aims to rebuild traditional financial services like loans and investments on the blockchain, bridges have become a prime target for hackers due to vulnerabilities in their underlying code. Bridges \"maintain large stores of liquidity,\" making them a \"tempting target for hackers,\" according to Jess Symington, research lead at blockchain analysis firm Elliptic. \"In order for individuals to use bridges to move their funds, assets are locked on one blockchain and unlocked, or minted, on another,\" Symington said. \"As a result, these services hold large volumes of cryptoassets.\" Harmony has not revealed exactly how the funds were stolen. However, one investor had raised concerns about the security of its Horizon bridge as far back as April. The security of the Horizon bridge hinged on a \"multisig\" wallet that required only two signatures to initiate transactions. Some researchers speculate the breach was the result of a \"private key compromise,\" where hackers obtained the password, or passwords, required to gain access to a crypto wallet. Harmony was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. It follows a series of notable attacks on other blockchain bridges. The Ronin Network, which supports crypto game Axie Infinity, lost more than $600 million in a security breach that took place in March. Wormhole, another popular bridge, lost over $320 million in a separate hack a month earlier. The heist adds to a stream of negative news in crypto lately. Crypto lenders Celsius and Babel Finance put a freeze on withdrawals after a sharp drop in the value of their assets resulted in a liquidity crunch. Meanwhile, beleaguered crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital could be set to default on a $660 million loan from brokerage firm Voyager Digital."

The cryptocurrency market has seen billions of dollars of value wiped off in the last few weeks, with bitcoin falling below the $20,000 mark over the weekend. Celsius offers high yields to users who deposit their crypto with the company by lending it out to other institutions to generate a profit. But last week, the company halted withdrawals for customers due to \"extreme market conditions.\" On Monday, Celcius asked customers for more time to deal with the situation. \"We want our community to know that our objective continues to be stabilizing our liquidity and operations. This process will take time,\" the company said in a blog post. \"As has been a priority since our company's inception, we maintain an open dialogue with regulators and officials. We plan to continue working with regulators and officials regarding this pause and our company's determination to find a resolution.\" Celsius said it would pause Twitter Spaces and Ask Me Anything, or AMAs, \"to focus on navigating these unprecedented challenges and seeking to fulfill our responsibilities to our community.\" Celsius has been hit with a confluence of factors that have put it on the brink of potential insolvency. The market downturn has eroded the value of the assets it holds. While a big exposure to a token called staked ether, or stETH, has furthered Celsius's liquidity issues."

Nurphoto | Getty Images Bitcoin jumped on Monday, after the cryptocurrency fell below its 2017 high over the weekend, but investors remained on edge thanks to a slew of negative crypto headlines and macro factors keeping pressure on sentiment. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap climbed above the $20,000 mark for much of the day Monday. However, it last edged lower by less than 1% to $20,005.46, according to Coin Metrics. Over the weekend, bitcoin fell as low as $17,601.58. Meanwhile, ether inched higher by less than 1% to $1,102.86. While investors will welcome the rebound, bitcoin still sits 70% below its all-time high, hit in November. It's down 57% year-to-date. Many have suggested a market bottom could be close, but with so much economic uncertainty remaining, bitcoin still has more downside potential, according to Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"Bitcoin's weekend dip was, to put it simply, not deep enough,\" he said. \"The macro environment has not really changed from last week's FOMC meeting: there still has not been a clear sign of inflation coming down and the Fed may still drive the economy into recession by raising rates too aggressively or simply by failing to tame inflation.\" 'Dead cat bounce' With bitcoin unable to hold convincingly above $20,000, industry watchers said the rally might be short-lived. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC that unless the price of bitcoin closes above $23,000 on a daily time frame basis, \"the odds are this is a dead cat bounce.\" \"We're oversold, so a bounce was expected,\" he added. The broader cryptocurrency market has been plagued by a number of issues in recent weeks, beginning with the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and associated token luna. Attention has now turned to crypto lending companies that promise users high yields for depositing their digital coins. Last week, Celsius, a company with 1.7 million customers and nearly $12 billion of crypto assets under management, paused withdrawal of funds for customers, sparking concerns that it is insolvent. Cryptocurrency companies have announced rounds of layoffs amid the market downturn. Coinbase, a crypto wallet and exchange, said last week it will cut 18% of full-time jobs. A lending firm called BlockFi said last week it will lay off a fifth of its staff. Macroeconomic factors including high inflation and upcoming rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve are also weighing on the market. \"When inflation is on the doorstep and with rate hikes in the offing, the risks of a recession round the bend are high,\" Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare, told CNBC via email. \"The push me pull you of higher rates sapping cash from mortgaged house owners means people are psychologically bracing and paring back and digital assets are suffering thus.\" \"Coupled with this, the pull back in the digital asset ecosystem has uncovered a number of systemic issues.\" Market bottom? Given the big fall in cryptocurrency prices in the last few weeks, some observers said that a bottom to the market could be close. Giles Keating, director of Bitcoin Suisse, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday that \"we're close to a point where some of the real excess leverage has now been driven out of the system and a bottom can begin to be formed.\" Leverage refers to trading in which investors effectively use borrowed money to make trades. That means investors can get larger exposure to positions with less initial capital. But that's seen as a risky means of trading as it requires investors to ensure they have enough capital to meet the so-called margin requirements. If they don't, their position is automatically liquidated. Those liquidations are seen as a big factor behind market moves. Keating said there is still a risk of further liquidation, but he thinks the majority of the selling is over. \"Now some people are warning that we are still not yet there and that if we were to break significantly lower, that we'd see another wave of liquidations,\" Keating said. \"There's always that risk hovering there. But my feeling, given I think those very very big double digit rebounds we saw, in bitcoin, particularly in ether, I think to my mind that was a sign that a lot of those really big liquidations are now done and that the base really is being formed.\""

The cryptocurrency exchange will cut 18% of full-time jobs, according to an email sent to employees Tuesday morning. Coinbase has roughly 5,000 full-time workers, translating to a head count reduction of around 1,100 people. Shares of Coinbase closed down .83%. CEO Brian Armstrong pointed to a possible recession, and a need to manage Coinbase's burn rate and increase efficiency. He also said the company grew \"too quickly\" during a bull market. \"We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,\" Armstrong said in the email, adding that past crypto winters have resulted in a significant decline in trading activity. \"While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment.\" Coinbase Founder and CEO Brian Armstrong attends Consensus 2019 at the Hilton Midtown on May 15, 2019 in New York City. Steven Ferdman | Getty Images Coinbase had initially said it was pausing hiring. Two weeks later, the crypto giant announced that it was extending the freeze for the \"foreseeable future.\" Earlier this year, Coinbase said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design. \"Our employee costs are too high to effectively manage this uncertain market,\" Armstrong said. \"While we tried our best to get this just right, in this case it is now clear to me that we over-hired.\" The news comes during a deep rout for Coinbase shares. The stock went public via a direct listing last April during a boom in crypto markets and investors clamoring for high-growth tech stocks. Coinbase's shares are down 79% this year and 85% from the all-time high. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped to near $22,000 and has lost 53% of its value this year. watch now VIDEO13:2313:23 Coinbase cuts 18% of workforce and bitcoin briefly falls to $20,000: CNBC Crypto World Crypto World San Francisco-based Coinbase reported a slump in users in its last quarter and a 27% decline in revenue from a year ago. The company gets the majority of its top line from transaction fees, which are closely tied to trading activity. President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi called it a \"very difficult decision for Coinbase\" but given the economic backdrop, she said it \"felt like the most prudent thing to do right now.\" Affected employees received a notification from human resources. If so, the memo was sent to a personal email as Coinbase cut off access to the company systems. Armstrong called it the \"only practical choice\" given the number of employees with access to customer information, and a way to \"ensure not even a single person made a rash decision that harmed the business or themselves.\" Employees of Coinbase Global Inc, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, watch as their listing is displayed on the Nasdaq MarketSite jumbotron at Times Square in New York, U.S., April 14, 2021. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters Coinbase employees will have access to a talent hub to find new jobs in the industry, including Coinbase Ventures' portfolio companies. Choi said Coinbase would still be \"doubling down\" on areas like security and compliance and may be \"reorienting\" employees to near-term revenue drivers. \"If there are any cuts to new product areas, it's going to be more around experimental venture areas that we're still very bullish on, but that we don't want to invest in in this part of the cycle,\" Choi told CNBC in an interview at the company's headquarters. \"We will continue to invest in incredible innovative areas of crypto that we think are emerging over the longer term, but we're probably going to do those in a more measured way in this type of an environment.\" Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC Pro This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia?

Crypto lender BlockFi said Monday it was cutting 20% of its employees. Open-source tracker Layoffs.fyi estimates that more than 5,500 start-up and tech jobs have been cut in June alone. Coinbase's intention is \"that this is a one-time event,\" Choi said adding that the company has $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company has lived through multiple bear markets in crypto before, also known as \"crypto winters.\" \"We will power through any macro environment, any crypto winter, or anything that's coming,\" she said. \"The reality though, is that we have to adjust when we feel that there's a very dynamic economic environment in play.\" Tech companies have been fighting low morale and attrition as their stocks get slammed. Last week, a petition posted to a decentralized publishing platform called for the removal and a \"vote of no confidence\" regarding several Coinbase executives, including Choi. Armstrong called attention to the since-deleted petition, and in a Tweet urged employees to quit if they don't believe in the company. \"We will always encourage our employees to share feedback internally on how we operate as a company \u2014 and we have a number of mechanisms in place for them to do so. It's very much unclear if this document came from within the company,\" Choi said. \"However, if it did, we're disappointed that those behind it felt the need to breach the trust of the company and their co-workers by sharing this information in a way clearly designed to drive controversy rather than a meaningful dialogue.\" Coinbase has no plans to offer additional company equity grants, or cash compensation amid the price drop, Choi said. The company offers annual grants, partially so employees could \"mitigate the swings\" and volatility in crypto. For employees and investors, the COO likened it to Amazon or Tesla: a long-term investment with volatility in the meantime. \"We think that anyone who makes an investment, whether they're an employee or investor, will have a handsome return over the longer term,\" Choi said. \"Coinbase is a long-term play \u2014 we have very deep conviction in the long-term value of the stock.\""

The sector's market cap collapse was led by terraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, which imploded virtually overnight. But bitcoin and ethereum, too, saw massive price declines from their recent bull market highs. A cultural icon known for being in touch with emotions \u2014 and for his recent foray into the NFT space \u2014 Deepak Chopra says investors can't ignore the recent crypto market meltdown, but they should be able to see beyond it. \"The crypto world is in crisis, having lost trillions of dollars.

Deepak Chopra, co-founder of the Chopra Center for Wellbeing and the founder of the Chopra Foundation. Adam Jeffery | CNBC It is unclear whether the recent rout marks the next \"crypto winter\" \u2014 a multiyear bear market that occurs on a cyclical basis for the crypto asset class \u2014 though dropping trading volumes on crypto exchanges is one sign that we may be headed in that direction. The last so-called crypto winter ran from 2018 into the fall of 2020 as the value of cryptocurrencies plunged and layoffs were rife. There are more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and dozens of blockchain platforms, the underlying technology that cryptocurrencies are built upon. Not all will survive, and some crypto industry leaders expect a period of \"creative destruction\" wiping out many players. Mark Cuban, who has become a big investor in blockchain-based technologies, recently compared the crypto crash to \"the lull that the internet went through\" during the dotcom bubble. He tweeted that there are too many imitators out there. \"The chains that copy what everyone else has, will fail,\" Cuban tweeted. \"We don't need NFTs or DeFi on every chain.\" Earlier this year, Chopra's foundation partnered with crypto crowdfunding platform EarthFund to launch a collection of NFT tokens aimed at helping people achieve mental and emotional health. Token holders can earn rewards that allow them to \"crowdfund a treasury and decide as a community which mental well-being projects get the funding they need to make a difference,\" according to a March statement. The Chopra Foundation has also participated in Hollywood actress Emilia Clarke's SameYou NFT initiative launched in November 2021, which aims to provide better treatment of those recovering from the injuries of brain stroke and injury. \"We're using artificial intelligence to talk to people who are feeling mentally challenged and if they need counseling, we have a token with EarthFund so that we can democratize well-being all over the world,\" Chopra said. \"This is the future. We want to create global communities of attention, affection, appreciation and acceptance, where people are there to support each other and have each others backs.\" NFTs are a type of digital asset created to track ownership of a virtual item using blockchain technology. Earlier this week, U.S. prosecutors announced that they're pursuing an insider trading charge involving these digital assets for the first time. \"I hope people don't get sucked into the melodrama [of NFTs], because the markets always reflect the fickle human mind. One day it's up, one day it's down, one bit of news and we're in a bull market, the next day there's bad news and we're in a bear market,\" Chopra said. \"Ultimately, history has shown that economic development will happen because we are creative human beings, but we have to hang in there and support each other. It's not a time for competition right now, but cooperation,\" he added."

        "detailedArticleContent": "A visual representation of Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Edward Smith | Getty Images Cryptocurrency companies dominated the main street at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, a notable difference between this edition and the last one in 2020. The high-profile presence from the industry came even as the cryptocurrency market crashed. It was sparked by the collapse of the so-called algorithmic stablecoin called terraUSD or UST, which saw its sister token luna drop to $0 in May. Meanwhile, global regulators are setting their sights on the cryptocurrency industry. WEF is the annual gathering of global business leaders and politicians that aims to set the agenda for the year. Against that backdrop, it was the perfect time to catch up with some of the big players in the cryptocurrency industry. Here's what I learned. Thousands of cryptos could collapse There are currently over 19,000 cryptocurrencies and dozens of blockchain platforms in existence. Blockchain is the technology that underpins these digital currencies and platforms include Ethereum, Solana and many others. Many of the industry executives see the current state of the market as unsustainable. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of cross-border blockchain firm Ripple, predicted there may only be \"scores\" of cryptocurrencies left in the future. He said there are around 180 fiat currencies in the world and there is not really a need for that many cryptocurrencies. watch now VIDEO4:1804:18 Crypto market got 'reckless' with latest crash, Polygon co-founder says Davos 2024: World Economic Forum Betrand Perez, CEO of the Web3 Foundation, likened the current state of the market to the early internet era, and said there were lots of \"scams\" and many \"were not bringing any value.\" Brett Harrison, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX U.S., said there are \"a couple of clear winners\" when it comes to blockchain platforms. Stablecoins: Talk of the town You may have heard of stablecoins. They're a type of cryptocurrencies which are supposed to be pegged to a real world asset. In practice, stablecoins like tether or USD Coin, which aim to mirror the U.S. dollar one-to-one, are backed by real assets such as currencies or bonds. They hold a reserve of these assets in order to maintain a dollar peg. watch now VIDEO2:0102:01 Circle CEO: Not all stablecoins are equal Davos 2024: World Economic Forum You may have also heard about the debacle surrounding a terraUSD or UST. This is a so-called algorithmic stablecoin. Instead of maintaining its peg by having a reserve of assets, it aims to mimic the U.S. dollar and maintain stability through a complex algorithm. But that algorithm failed and caused terraUSD to lose its peg and collapse. The crypto industry tried to warn users to make sure they know the difference between an algorithmic stablecoin, like terraUSD, and others that are backed by assets. Everyone wants to be more more involved with crypto now, no one is ignoring the industry anymore. Mihailo Bjelic CEO of Polygon The terraUSD collapse \"made it very clear to people that not all stablecoins are created equal,\" said Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, one of the companies behind the issuance of USDC. \"And it's helping people differentiate between a well-regulated, fully reserved, asset-backed dollar digital currency, like USDC, and something like that (terraUSD).\" Reeve Collins, co-founder of BLOCKv and co-founder of another stablecoin tether, said the terraUSD saga will \"probably be the end\" of most algorithmic stablecoins. Industry welcomes the bear market Believe it or not, the cryptocurrency industry welcomed the recent market crash, which saw major tokens like bitcoin fall more than 50% from their all-time highs. \"We're in a bear market. And I think that's good. It's good, because it's going to clear the people who were there for the bad reasons,\" said the Web3 Foundation's Perez. watch now VIDEO1:3501:35 Crypto industry hopes bear market will remove 'bad actors' in the space Davos 2024: World Economic Forum This sentiment was echoed by other executives too, who say the massive rally in prices caused people to focus on speculation rather than building products. \u2033[The] market, in my personal opinion, became maybe a little bit irrational, or maybe a little reckless to a certain extent. And when the times like that come, [a] correction is normally needed, and at the end of the day [is] healthy,\" said Mihailo Bjelic, CEO of Polygon. Regulation is coming but thinking has shifted Ahead of the World Economic Forum, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said she thinks cryptocurrencies are \"worth nothing.\" It appeared to me like regulators and authorities were still antagonistic to cryptocurrencies, much like they had been over the past few years at Davos. But executives said the thinking from regulators, for the most part, has shifted to something slightly more constructive. \"I think we've come a long way from three or four years ago when when I literally had just arrived here in the snowy version of Davos and someone said, you know, crypto is still a bad word here. That is no longer the case. So I definitely don't think 'antagonism' would be the right descriptor. I think 'curiosity,'\" Ripple's Garlinghouse said. watch now VIDEO4:1504:15 Ripple CEO calls for 'clarity and certainty' from regulators on crypto Davos 2024: World Economic Forum \"I think it's constantly changing both regulators, big enterprises. Everyone wants to be more more involved with crypto now, no one is ignoring the industry anymore,\" Polygon's Bjelic said. In March, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. Still, there is no major cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. and other major economies. Garlinghouse said that he wants \"clarity and certainty\" from regulators. BLOCKv's Collins, meanwhile, called Lagarde's comments \"ignorant.\" He highlighted the tension that still exists between the cryptocurrency industry and some authorities in traditional finance. watch now VIDEO8:1808:18 How a $60 billion crypto collapse got regulators worried Crypto Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook."

Here's what it means Crypto Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is launching its own venture capital fund. The company's venture arm, Binance Labs, said Wednesday it has raised $500 million for its debut start-up fund, securing backing from partners at DST Global and Breyer Capital as well as unnamed family offices and corporations. It comes after Andreessen Horowitz last week announced a mammoth $4.5 billion fund to invest in crypto start-ups. Binance Labs plans to use the capital to invest in companies building \"Web3.\" Though still an ill-defined term, Web3 loosely refers to a hypothetical future iteration of the internet that's more decentralized than online platforms today and incorporates blockchain, the shared digital ledgers behind most major cryptocurrencies. The launch of Binance's new fund arrives at a time when bitcoin and other digital currencies are down sharply. Bitcoin has plunged more than 50% since reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. That's taken a toll on publicly-listed crypto companies like Coinbase, whose shares have plunged 69% since the start of 2022. Investors fear the slump will feed through to privately-held crypto start-ups. Binance is the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, handling $490 billion of spot trading volumes in March 2022. Akio Kon | Bloomberg | Getty Images While start-up valuations of $1 billion or more are \"slowing down a bit,\" there's \"no current impact in early-stage private markets,\" Ken Li, Binance Labs' executive director of investments and M&A, told CNBC. Binance Labs is hoping to capitalize on the recent plunge in digital assets to find founders building what it sees as the next big thing in tech. Its bets will be split into pre-seed, early-stage and growth equity, and the fund will invest in tokens as well as shares. \"We are looking for projects with the potential to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem,\" Li said. Such projects may include infrastructure, nonfungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations. Binance estimates there are currently around 300,000 to 500,000 active Web3 developers, a number it hopes to grow \"substantially.\" Binance has made a series of high-profile equity investments in the past year. This is the first time the company has formally raised a VC fund with financing from external investors. Binance Labs' investment portfolio includes business news magazine Forbes and Sky Mavis, the company behind popular nonfungible token game Axie Infinity. It was also an investor in Terraform Labs, the embattled Singapore-based start-up behind failed stablecoin project Terra. watch now VIDEO50:0450:04 What is Web3? We ask the man who invented the word Beyond the Valley Videos Binance Labs \"always does its due diligence and has strong conviction in its investment strategy,\" Li said. \"We know that investing in early stages involves risks,\" he added. \"The industry is still young and was younger back then.\" Binance is also planning to take a $500 million stake in Twitter to support Elon Musk's bid to acquire the social media service, a move the firm hopes will boost its aim of \"bringing social media and Web3 together.\" Founded in 2017 by Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur Changpeng Zhao, Binance is the world's biggest digital currency exchange. The firm handled $490 billion of spot trading volumes in March, according to CryptoCompare data. In an interview with CNBC earlier this year, Zhao said Binance had \"billions ready to invest\" in Web3. The trend has been met with skepticism from some notable figures in tech, including Musk and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Zhao said he's a believer in the concept, but that it will take time to make it a reality. \"Exactly how it's going to shape up, what exactly Web3 looks like, which company, which projects \u2014 nobody knows,\" he said. \"Before Facebook started, nobody could predict that,\" Zhao added. \"We'll just have to see what turns out.\""

The government on Tuesday proposed amending existing rules to manage the failure of stablecoin firms that may pose a \"systemic\" risk. The proposal is separate from previously announced plans to regulate stablecoins under laws governing electronic payments. \"Since the initial commitment to regulate certain types of stablecoins, events in cryptoasset markets have further highlighted the need for appropriate regulation to help mitigate consumer, market integrity and financial stability risks,\" the government said in a consultation paper setting out its proposals. \"The government considers that it is important to ensure existing legal frameworks can be effectively applied to manage the risks posed by the possible failure of systemic DSA [digital settlement asset] firms for the purposes of financial stability.\" Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a traditional asset, most often the U.S. dollar. TerraUSD, a so-called \"algorithmic\" stablecoin, was meant to follow this arrangement using a mix of code and partial backing from bitcoin and other digital tokens. But it imploded earlier this month, taking an associated token called luna tumbling with it. Panic over the debacle has erased hundreds of billions of dollars from the entire crypto market. That has, in turn, caused concern for regulators, who are worried about the risks posed by stablecoins to the broader financial system. Tether, the world's biggest stablecoin, saw more than $10 billion in redemptions in the weeks following Terra's collapse, fueling fears of a 2008-style \"bank run\" with knock-on effects for other financial markets. Though Tether says its token is fully backed by assets held in a reserve, critics remain unconvinced and have called for a full audit. The government is looking to implement additional safeguards to existing legislation around insolvency of firms operating key financial market infrastructure. Such a provision would take into account the return or transfer of the private keys that protect users' funds. The Bank of England would serve as the lead regulator enforcing the rules. A consultation on the proposal is currently underway and will close on Aug. 2. Glen Goodman, a crypto advisor to eToro, said the proposal was \"pretty dramatic.\" The government has \"effectively accepted that some stablecoins may become as systemically important as banks and so should be treated as special cases and assisted if they're failing,\" he said."

Last week, supporters of the Terra blockchain project voted to revive luna but not terraUSD, a so-called \"stablecoin\" that plunged below its intended peg to the dollar, causing panic in the crypto market. TerraUSD, or UST, is what's known as an algorithmic stablecoin. It relied on code and a sister token, luna, to maintain a $1 value. But as digital currency prices fell, investors fled the stablecoin, sending UST tumbling \u2014 and taking luna down with it. At its height, the old luna \u2014 now known as \"luna classic\" \u2014 had a circulating supply of over $40 billion. Now, luna has a new iteration, which investors are calling Terra 2.0.

After reaching a peak of $19.53 on Saturday, luna dropped as low as $4.39 just hours later, according to CoinMarketCap data. It has since settled at a price of around $5.90.

Kate Munsch | Reuters Andreessen Horowitz plans to plow billions of dollars into crypto start-ups while digital asset markets are in a rut. The Silicon Valley firm announced a new $4.5 billion fund for backing crypto and blockchain companies on Wednesday. It marks Andreessen's fourth fund for the asset class and brings its total raised for crypto and blockchain investments to $7.6 billion. The firm plans to invest in both the cryptocurrencies behind projects and in company equity. Andreessen's first crypto-focused fund was launched four years ago, during a downturn now known as \"crypto winter.\" \"Bear markets are often when the best opportunities come about, when people are actually able to focus on building technology rather than getting distracted by short-term price activity,\" Arianna Simpson, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz told CNBC in a phone interview. Cryptocurrencies have slid significantly from their all-time highs, with bitcoin down more than 50% since its November peak, and they remain tightly correlated to higher growth tech stocks, which have undergone a major slide this year. Earlier in May, the crash of stablecoin TerraUSD shook investor sentiment and caught the attention of regulators. But Simpson said investors should not worry about the firm's bets. \"The technical diligence and the other kinds of diligence that we do are a key part of of making sure that projects meet our bar,\" she said. \"While our pace of investment has been high, we continue to invest really in only the top echelon of founders.\" Simpson and partner Chris Dixon liken the long-term opportunity in crypto to the next major computing cycle, after PCs in the 1980s, the internet in the 1990s and mobile computing in the early 2000s. Andreessen Horowitz is known for early bets on Lyft, Pinterest and Slack, and made its first major crypto investment with Coinbase in 2013. The firm has since backed a variety of start-ups in the crypto and NFT space, including Alchemy, Avalanche, Dapper Labs, OpenSea, Solana and Yuga Labs. Earlier this week it invested in Flowcarbon, a carbon-credit trading platform on the blockchain also backed by controversial WeWork founder Adam Neumann. While cryptocurrencies may be struggling to regain momentum, money flowing into private companies is at all-time highs. Blockchain start-ups brought in a record $25 billion in venture capital dollars last year, according to recent data from CB Insights. That figure is up eightfold from a year earlier. The flood of investment into so-called \"Web3\" start-ups trying to build businesses on blockchain technology has inspired scorn from some tech luminaries. Two of the world's best-known tech billionaires, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, have been among those questioning \"Web3.\" Dorsey argues VCs and their limited partners are the ones who will ultimately end up owning Web3 and it \"will never escape their incentives,\" he tweeted, calling it a \"centralized entity with a different label.\" \"The people who are skeptical are not where we are, which is again in the fortunate position of being able to talk to these brilliant builders all day,\" Simpson said. \"The other thing I would add is that many of the skeptics are the titans of Web 2.0 \u2014 they have been very much in a position to profit from and benefit from the closed platforms.\" Clarification: While Andreessen Horowitz was a seed investor in Brbn, the company that later pivoted to become photo-sharing platform called Instagram, it passed on the chance to invest in Instagram itself."

The Promenade, a main strip where companies and governments take over shops and bars during the week of the forum, are dominated by crypto companies, nestled between major firms like Salesforce and Facebook-owner Meta. \"It's a big step for the crypto industry, they were always anti-Davos,\" one delegate told CNBC. On Sunday, Tether, the company behind the stablecoin USDT, set up a stand giving away free pizza on the Promenade for Bitcoin Pizza Day. On May 22, 2010, a programmer bought pizza using bitcoin and it is widely seen as the first transaction using the cryptocurrency. The day is celebrated every year by the crypto community. Another delegate remarked that crypto companies were \"splashing the cash.\" Non-fungible tokens is a big topic during discussions around the World Economic Forum. RollApp, which runs an NFT store, set up a location in Davos to promote the digital collectibles. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC Fernando Verboonen, co-founder of RollApp, a non-fungible token (NFT) store, which took over a shop on the Promenade, estimated about 60% of the venues on the street were crypto-related companies. \"They are basically taking over Davos,\" he said. Non-fungible tokens are digital collectibles. RollApp is trying to turn real-world assets such as cars into NFTs. 'Crazy few weeks' The industry's strong showing at Davos comes despite a recent market crash. More than $500 billion has been wiped off the crypto market in the last month, as the collapse of stablecoin terraUSD sent shockwaves across the industry. Those who are at Davos likely committed to taking over a space on the Promenade in the Alpine ski resort before the recent market fall. \"It's been a crazy few weeks in crypto. We committed to coming here a long time ago but that wasn't going to change. We are in a position that we are going to withstand the bear market and there will be a bull run again,\" Clifford Sarkin, the COO at blockchain start-up Casper Labs, told CNBC. Circle, which is one of the companies behind the USDC stablecoin, took over one of the shops on the Davos Promenade. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC Casper Labs has a blockchain product aimed at businesses. Blockchain came to prominence with bitcoin but its definition has expanded. It is effectively a shared ledger of activity that could underpin applications in business such as cross-border money transfers, proponents say. Sarkin said the crash had been positive for company's like his that are focused on selling blockchain to business customers, rather than consumers. \"It's easier to do business in a bear cycle. A lot of the people who came last year and were trying to make money in crypto that are now leaving because they're saying crypto is dead, are now out of the space for a while and we are going to get to do real business,\" he told CNBC.

Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images FTX has been on the hunt to buy brokerage start-ups as the crypto exchange expands into stocks, and its CEO takes a major stake in Robinhood. The Bahamas-based company has approached at least three privately held trading start-ups about an acquisition, according to sources familiar with those negotiations, who asked not to be named because the deal talks were confidential. The discussions were still early and did not result in a term sheet, one source said. Webull, Apex Clearing and Public.com were among the companies FTX has spoken to in recent months, sources said. Webull, Apex and Public.com declined CNBC's requests for comment. FTX didn't respond to a comment request. The move comes as investors increasingly hold crypto and stocks, and brokerage firms look to offer the assets under one roof. Robinhood has pivoted its business model away from just stocks and focused on cryptocurrencies, while SoFi, Block and other fintechs now offer both. Last week, FTX said it would make a move into equities. It plans to offer commission-free trading in the U.S. in an effort to acquire more customers. \"The U.S. has the largest retail base in the world and you don't want to have to split into two different apps to trade two different asset classes,\" Brett Harrison, president of FTX U.S., told CNBC in a phone interview last week. \"This is not a revenue-generating model for us, it's more of a user acquisition strategy.\" FTX has already made strategic investments in the space. It bought a stake in IEX Group, one of the largest stock exchange operators, in April. Earlier in May, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried took a 7.6% stake in Robinhood fueling speculation that the crypto company may be looking at an acquisition. Robinhood shares are down more than 85% since reaching their all-time high around the initial public offering last summer. While a regulatory filing said Bankman-Fried sees Robinhood as an \"attractive investment\" with no plans to buy it or push changes at the company, the paperwork raised some eyebrows. The SEC filing was a 13D, is typically used by activist investors. Passive investors would normally file a 13G. Still, a Robinhood takeover may be a tough without the founders' blessing. Robinhood's dual-class share structure gives co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev and co-founder Baiju Bhatt more than 60% of the voting power. Analysts are expecting more consolidation in the space with fintech stocks plummeting from all-time highs and some private valuations compressing. \"Many in the industry are flush with cash and strategic acquisitions can accelerate growth, so we expect demand will remain strong,\" said Devin Ryan, director of financial technology research at JMP Securities. \"We expect buyers will be looking for targets that add a product capability and expertise, broaden the customer footprint as customer acquisition costs have risen, or even simply add talent in a competitive hiring landscape.\""

Yuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty Images China's state-backed blockchain company is planning its first major international expansion, its CEO told CNBC, as Beijing continues to make the technology a key priority. Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) bills itself as a \"one-stop shop\" to deploy blockchain applications in the cloud, a process that could otherwise be costly and time consuming. It aims to link different blockchains together to help businesses deploy the technology. Hong Kong-headquartered start-up Red Date Technology is one of the founding members of BSN. The company's CEO Yifan He told CNBC that BSN is planning to launch a project called BSN Spartan Network overseas in August. Blockchain came to prominence with the cryptocurrency bitcoin but its definition has since expanded. It refers to a system of shared ledgers of activity, which could be public and available for all to see, or private, where only certain participants can use and modify it. Bitcoin is an example of a public blockchain. BSN's blockchain networks, however, do not operate with any cryptocurrencies because China has cracked down on digital coins. Proponents of blockchain technology say that it can reduce the cost and increase the speed of some business processes. Chinese President Xi Jinping has personally endorsed the technology, elevating it to a national priority. The international plan will be a major push for BSN. The Spartan Network will eventually be made up of half a dozen public blockchains that do not operate with cryptocurrencies.

More pain is coming, Smith says, more risk will be exposed, but ultimately, it's a good thing for the decentralized economy. For the crypto investor, he says the lesson of the past few weeks should be back to the crypto equivalent of the traditional market investing concept of dollar-cost averaging \u2014 slowly building a position in an asset over time so all your money isn't exposed to any single bout of volatility. \"Average into it slowly,\" Smith told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange.\" Bitcoin hit its lowest level since December 2020 earlier this week, under $26,000, and shares of publicly traded crypto brokerage company Coinbase were down by as much as 74% year-to-date this week, \"And you need to be prepared to hold it for quite some time,\" Smith added. \"Because we're still in really the nascent period of building this whole finance system out.\" Blockchain.com, one of the more established players in the space, founded in 2011, ranked No. 7 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

Anushree Fadnavis | Reuters Block executives no longer want the firm to be seen as a payments pure play. The San Francisco-based company held its first investor day in five years Wednesday, where the C-suite made its case to Wall Street that the money app, along with its crypto and music-streaming businesses, should be valued as an \"ecosystem\" instead. \"Calling Block a payments company is like calling Amazon a bookseller,\" CFO Amrita Ahuja told CNBC in a phone interview. \"We've grown in so many different ways across multiple dimensions.\" Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who formerly ran Twitter, kicked off Wednesday's presentation with a keynote on the evolution of Block and bitcoin's role in it going forward. It's \"difficult\" to fit a company like Block into a single category, he said. watch now VIDEO2:0102:01 Block is no longer just a payments company, CEO Jack Dorsey says at company's investor day TechCheck \"We are no longer just a payments company,\" Dorsey said during the livestreamed event. \"A lot has changed since our last investor day.\" Square was founded in 2009 and made its name by creating a credit card reader for mobile phones. The company expanded its scope to peer-to-peer payments and bank-like products with Cash App. It also acquired Afterpay and Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service. The company also operates an FDIC-insured bank, and it offers stock and cryptocurrency trading. Square's corporate renaming to Block was meant in part to reflect that widening aperture and broader plans around crypto and blockchain. While fintechs were among the best performers during the coronavirus pandemic, Block and its peers have been pummeled in 2022 amid rising interest rates. Ark's Fintech Innovation ETF, a basket of fintech names, is down more than 60% year to date. Block itself has fallen more than 45% in 2022. Focus on profits Still, Block's CFO, Ahuja said the company is outperforming its peers on profitability. Block released updated profit margins Wednesday \u2014 an increasingly important metric as investors prioritize the bottom line over growth. Adjusted profit margins for the Square side of the business last year were 34%, and they were 12% for Cash App, according to the company. On the pure-growth side, Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users and 80 million annual actives as of March. \"Wall Street analysts are going to want to understand our growth profile, and our margin structure as a company \u2014 you can see based on our track record we are outgrowing the rest of the industry,\" Ahuja said. \"We operate in a large and growing market and are still taking share.\" Block closed a $29 billion deal to buy Australian fintech company Afterpay earlier this year as it expands into the installment loan market. The CFO highlighted the cross-selling opportunity with roughly 6% of its Cash App users also using AfterPay. The lending sector has become popular for consumers and merchants, along with a surge in online shopping. It spreads out the cost of a larger purchase into four interest-free installments. Despite pushback from consumer watchdogs, Ahuja contended that it's safer than a traditional card because consumers can't take on additional loans if they miss a payment. \"Millennials and Gen Z's are quite frankly skeptical of traditional forms of credit, that leave people in debt spirals,\" she said. Block also acquired Jay-Z's music streaming business Tidal for roughly $300 million last year \u2014 at the time a head scratcher for some payment analysts. Dorsey said it was a bet on the creator economy, which he argues will continue to grow as artificial intelligence removes \"more and more of the need for mechanical work.\" \"This will be a massive economy in the future, and we see an opportunity to be a big part of it, all using the tools and platform we've already built,\" Dorsey said. \"We acquired Tidal because we saw that artists take a path similar to small businesses, and that there's a significant gap in the market around artist tools.\" Dorsey's case for bitcoin As of the quarter ended in March, bitcoin still only accounted for roughly 5% of Block's gross profits. But executives are betting on crypto as a secular trend in which Block could be well positioned. Dorsey described it as the \"open standard for global money transmission\" and said it will allow Block's \"entire business to move faster globally.\" Block first started offering bitcoin trading through the Cash App, and the company holds it on its balance sheet as an alternative to cash. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down more than 50% from its high and has struggled to regain its value so far this year. Block's crypto businesses have expanded to a bitcoin hardware wallet, a bitcoin-mining business, and an open-source business called TBD for developers. On top of that, there's an independent, bitcoin-focused business within Block called Spiral. Dorsey is not as bullish on other cryptocurrencies and said the \"internet requires a currency native to itself, and in looking at the entire ecosystem of technologies to fill this role, it's clear that bitcoin is currently the only candidate.\" \"Its development may feel slow relative to other candidates, but that's a result of the deliberateness required to preserve the attributes necessary for money storage and transmission,\" Dorsey said."

The trading and investing company announced Tuesday it will let users hold and custody their own cryptocurrencies and NFTs in a separate, stand-alone app. It's the latest move in the digital asset space for Robinhood as it reaches for growth beyond stock trading. The company shares are off more than 70% since its IPO. The new app will put Robinhood squarely in competition with Coinbase and start-ups like MetaMask. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called his company's product the most downloaded, mobile self-custody wallet in the U.S. in a tweet Monday. Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder Robinhood Markets, Inc., is displayed on a screen during his company\u2019s IPO at the Nasdaq Market site in Times Square in New York City, U.S., July 29, 2021. Brendan McDermid | Reuters The app will let users store non-fungible tokens, and connect to NFT marketplaces and \"decentralized\" stock exchanges. It will also let users earn yield through other platforms and access a \"variety\" of crypto assets on other exchanges, Robinhood said. Who holds, or \"custodies,\" someone's cryptocurrency has become a contentious question in the industry, fueling the viral phrase \"not your keys, not your coins.\" Some fear storing assets on an exchange makes them more vulnerable to hacks, or censorship. Robinhood, which topped last year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, made its name by offering commission-free stock trading. Its value and user base soared during the pandemic as it ushered in a new generation of traders. The company also became the center of the meme-stock saga after restricting trading in GameStop, the highly shorted name Reddit traders bought in defiance of Wall Street short sellers. The trading business has slowed significantly over the past year. For the three months ended March 31, Robinhood's revenue fell 43% from a year ago. Since its public debut in August, shares have plummeted more than 70% and are more than 88% off of the all-time high. In an effort to spur revenue and user growth, Robinhood has been adding more cryptocurrency products and features, and in late March it added extended stock trading hours. It launched an earlier version crypto of wallets to customers in April, which will still be available within the core Robinhood app. \"We believe that crypto is more than just an asset class,\" Vlad Tenev, Robinhood's co-founder and CEO said in a press release. \"By offering the same low cost and great design that people have come to expect from Robinhood, our web3 wallet will make it easier for everyone to hold their own keys and experience all the opportunities that the open financial system has to offer.\" Robinhood said the new wallet will roll out with a waitlist first and will be available internationally. The new app notably won't charge network fees, despite Ethereum and bitcoin fees running at $70 in some cases. A Robinhood spokesperson said the crypto product will rely on third-party liquidity providers \"competing\" for customers' transactions behind the scenes, in order to offset those network fees. Robinhood makes most of its revenue off of transaction fees in its core trading business, through a brokerage-industry practice called payment for order flow. --- CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed reporting."

It counts basketball legends Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant among its more notable early investors. The Vancouver-based company has also developed its own blockchain designed for NFTs, called Flow.

They entered mainstream consciousness in a big way last year. In fact, sales of nonfungible tokens jumped to more than $17 billion in 2021, according to a report from NFT data company Nonfungible.com. The study, developed with BNP Paribas-owned research firm L'Atelier, said trading in NFTs hit $17.6 billion last year, reflecting an eye-watering 21,000% surge from 2020\u2032s total of $82 million. Dapper Labs recently unveiled a partnership with LaLiga, Spain's top soccer league, to introduce a similar experience to NBA Top Shot for soccer fans. For years, crypto critics have maligned the world's shift toward digital currency for \"proof-of-work\" mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity. \"Unlike other blockchains, we designed Flow to be the cleanest and most energy efficient alternative, where minting an NFT on Flow emits less carbon than posting on a social network,\" Dapper Labs told CNBC. The company secured $250 million in September that valued it at $7.5 billion. The company said it plans to invest part of the fresh cash into new experiences, like paid trips and big sporting events.

A shortage of food around the world is not the result of insufficient supply, but rather the inability to get it to where it needs to go before it goes bad. Nearly 25% of fruits and vegetables are lost globally, and North America is among the regions with the highest level of food waste. The World Bank estimates global food waste to be a $2.5 trillion problem. That's where Lineage Logistics comes in. Its mission is to transform the food supply chain by operating a global network of temperature-controlled cold-storage facilities for proteins, bakery products, dairy, and fruits and vegetables. It \"blast freezes\" cold air at temperatures as low as -25 to -35 Fahrenheit on up to 5 million pounds of product a day at a single facility. It then combines that proprietary solution with the ability to design warehouse racks that store products as efficiently as possible.

CFOTO | Future Publishing via Getty Images Investors have been eager to find out what happened to the $3 billion in bitcoin bought up by crypto firm Terra to back its failed stablecoin. Now, they've got their answer. Luna Foundation Guard, a fund set up by Terra creator Do Kwon, said Monday it spent almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve last week in a futile attempt to save terraUSD \u2014 or UST, for short. The foundation had accumulated a total of more than 80,000 bitcoins, which was worth nearly $3 billion last week, as well as other tokens including BNB, tether, USDC and avalanche. Kwon had promised to use the bitcoin in the event of a dramatic fall in the value of UST. In a series of tweets, Luna Foundation Guard said it transferred 52,189 bitcoins to \"trade with a counterparty\" as UST fell below its intended $1 peg. A further 33,206 bitcoins were sold by Terra directly in a last-ditch effort to defend the peg, the foundation said. As of Monday, Luna Foundation Guard had just 313 bitcoins left in its reserve, worth approximately $9.3 million. The firm said it would use the remainder of its $85 million in crypto assets \u2014 including some BNB and avalanche \u2014 to \"compensate remaining users\" of UST. \"We are still debating through various distribution methods, updates to follow soon,\" Luna Foundation Guard said. UST is what's known as an \"algorithmic\" stablecoin. Unlike tether and USDC, which hold fiat assets in a reserve to back their tokens, UST relied on a complex set of code, coupled with a floating token called luna, to balance supply and demand and stabilize the price. When UST began to drop below $1 last week, luna also started to sell off, resulting in a vicious cycle that caused UST to plunge to less than 30 cents while luna became worthless. UST is now worth just 9 cents, according to CoinGecko data. \"The big problem when you're dealing with a partially collateralized stablecoin like UST is that your hard collateral \u2014 bitcoin, in this case \u2014 is going to be considerably more valuable to [investors] than your governance token,\" or luna, said Frances Coppola, an independent economist. watch now VIDEO2:0402:04 Luna's bitcoin liquidation marks significant reversal: Castle Island Ventures' Nic Carter Crypto World Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic estimates holders of UST and luna have lost a total of $42 billion over the past week. Analysis from the company shows that 52,189 bitcoins were moved to a single account at crypto exchange Gemini, while a further 28,205 bitcoins were transferred to Binance. Tom Robinson, chief scientist at Elliptic, said it was \"not possible\" to trace the movement of funds beyond these wallets. The debacle rippled through crypto markets, wiping out more than $200 billion of wealth in a single day. Bitcoin on Thursday briefly fell below $26,000, its lowest level since December 2020. The world's biggest cryptocurrency was last trading at $29,526.75, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours. \"There's not a whole lot of outstanding sell pressure,\" said Dustin Teander, analyst at crypto research firm Messari. \"In a sense, the market is going to take that as kind of bullish.\""

        "detailedArticleContent": "Yuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared that his country needs to \"seize the opportunities\" presented by blockchain technology. In a speech in 2019, the Chinese leader said blockchain was an \"important breakthrough in independent innovation of core technologies.\" As a result of that speech, blockchain was elevated to a national priority for China, among other technologies \u2014 such as semiconductors \u2014 that the country is trying to boost its capabilities in. Since then, without much publicity and fanfare, China has been building a platform that aims to facilitate the deployment of blockchain technology for companies. It's called Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN). Here's what we know so far. First, what is blockchain? Blockchain first came to prominence as the underlying technology of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It is a distributed ledger of activity that records transactions on the bitcoin network. It is decentralized and no single entity owns or runs it. Instead, it's maintained by a network of participants running specialized computers. Since then, there have been many different definitions of what a blockchain could look like. Some companies or governments might refer to it as distributed ledger technology. Much of that derives from whether the blockchain is public or private. We think blockchain technology is so powerful it will change the entire internet and almost all the entire IT system architecture. Yifan He CEO, Red Date Technology Permissionless blockchains \u2014 also known as trustless or public blockchains \u2014 allow anyone to join and potentially make changes to the blockchain, so long as they are running a particular software or a device. In contrast, permissioned blockchains are usually private and only allow certain participants to be involved in their use. Why use blockchain? Proponents of the technology say that blockchain can help bring transparency and speed to typically slow and expensive processes, such as cross-border money transfers. Another important aspect of blockchain technology is so-called smart contracts. These are contracts, written in code, that execute automatically if certain conditions are met. Proponents see these as being key in areas such as trade finance. \"We think blockchain technology is so powerful it will change the entire internet and almost all the entire IT system architecture,\" Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology, told CNBC. Red Date Technology is one of the founding members of China's Blockchain-based Service Network. watch now VIDEO4:4404:44 What is Blockchain? CNBC Explains \"Blockchain technology in general is very important for China, as government officials see it as a low barrier to entry technology sector, and want Chinese companies to push the envelope on using blockchain applications to solve real world problems,\" Paul Triolo, the technology policy lead at consulting firm Albright Stonebridge, told CNBC. What can China's BSN do? BSN's product is aimed at companies, in particular, those operating cloud computing infrastructure. That could be a large public cloud player like Amazon or Microsoft, or it could be a firm that runs its own private cloud or intranet. BSN bills itself as a \"one-stop shop\" to deploy these blockchain applications in the cloud, a process that could otherwise be costly and time consuming. The Chinese firm's other selling point is that it is trying to solve a difficult problem in the industry: interoperability \u2014 or making different blockchains work with each other. For example, if two banks both had applications that were built on different blockchain platforms, they may not be able to work with each other. But applications built via BSN infrastructure would be interoperable as the company bridges different blockchains. For companies that want to use several blockchain applications in their organization, BSN's product would allow them to do that via the cloud vendor they use rather than installing a bunch of new servers to build a blockchain product. The idea is that a business or government can use BSN's platform to easily deploy blockchain applications, without incurring a high cost. The demand now is low, according to Red Date's He, but he is bullish on the long-term future of the product. \"I believe in 10 years all clouds will have a standard blockchain environment to handle all blockchain-related applications,\" the CEO said. One key point about BSN, however, is that it doesn't make its own blockchain. There is no cryptocurrency attached to BSN's platform. That's because China has effectively banned cryptocurrency-related activities and made them illegal. Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic, a venture capital firm and investor in Red Date Technology, told CNBC that governments and large-scale companies don't want or need a cryptocurrency attached to their infrastructure. \"This is where non-crypto use case comes in and BSN offers a compelling infrastructure,\" Chu said. Non-crypto blockchains could be appealing to large firms that don't want to be exposed to the risky and volatile nature of digital currencies. Who is behind BSN? Start-up Red Date Technology, which is headquartered in Hong Kong, is one of the founding companies behind BSN. But the project is also backed by entities with links to the Chinese government. This includes the State Information Center (SIC) under China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company, is also backing the project. Challenge of going global BSN has ambitions to go global. However, its links to the Chinese government could make it difficult. \"Part of the interest in BSN is that it is such an ambitious undertaking. This ambition also means that it has come under heavy scrutiny because of the Chinese government connection,\" said Triolo from Albright Stonebridge. He added that BSN \"is trying to separate the BSN International portion from the domestic efforts, and [trying] to distance from Chinese government backing.\" The challenge is not lost on He, the CEO of Red Date Technology. \"It's a huge, huge challenge,\" he acknowledged when asked about the plan to go global and the perception of being linked to the Chinese government. He said the international version of the platform will be open-source, allowing participants in the public domain to inspect the code for any potential backdoors.

He said \"a lot of people are not interested\" in the non-crypto blockchain offering. Blockchain vs. China's ambitions For the last few years, the U.S. have been engaged in an intense tech rivalry. China has focused on what it calls \"frontier\" technologies including quantum computing and semiconductors. Blockchain is another area of importance. Chinese tech companies have also placed a lot of emphasis on international expansion, a move supported by Beijing in the context of the global tech battle with the U.S. \"The significance of the Blockchain Services Network is that it is an attempt by the Chinese government to support the development of blockchain ecosystems on its own terms, with allowances for regulatory approaches in different jurisdictions,\" Triolo said."

State law enforcement officials say Flamingo Casino Club's operators failed to disclose its Russian ties and claimed it had partnerships with legitimate businesses when it didn't. The civil filing represents a new and coordinated effort by state regulators to police some of what is going on amid the explosive growth of the metaverse, where innovation and speculation have also provided fertile territory for criminals engaged in alleged fraud, theft and deception. State securities boards in Texas, Wisconsin, Kentucky, New Jersey and Alabama filed a 22-page emergency cease-and-desist order outlining what they allege are false claims by Flamingo Casino Club and requiring that it immediately halt the sale of its non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Source: Flamingo Casino Club \"The offering is simply a high-tech scam,\" the order said. NFTs are blockchain-based digital assets that designate ownership of virtual art, music or, in this case, proprietorship of a metaverse casino to whoever holds the NFT. Moreover, every NFT has unique properties that cannot be replicated, proving its authenticity. Investigators began scrutinizing the casino in March not long after it began operating and say they were ultimately able to trace the people behind it to Moscow. In an exclusive interview, the lead agency's top official told CNBC the casino lured in hopeful investors with false promises. \"I was absolutely shocked,\" said Joe Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board. Virtual concerts, poker tournaments and tennis courts are just a few of the perks listed on the organization's website. Flamingo Casino Club's website also told NFT holders they would receive 50% of the profits generated from the casino as passive income. It further enticed patrons by offering a chance to win exorbitant prizes such as Teslas and iPhones in its randomized lotteries, according to its website.

Source: Flamingo Casino Club The casino also widely marketed its affiliation with a well-known gambling establishment, the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, to secure investors' trust. But behind the fancy graphics, the promises of profits and the big-name backings was a scheme out of Russia to defraud investors that a team of state regulators unraveled, the order says. Flamingo Casino Club is \"intentionally failing to disclose its assets, liabilities, revenue and other financial information germane to its operations and the development and management of the metaverse casino,\" according to the order. The order says that although the casino sells securitized NFTs, it failed to provide purchasers with fundamental information such as its physical address, phone number, or any evidence proving the people on its leadership team actually existed.

It goes into a black hole through the blockchain, and people may lose everything.\" Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Screenshot taken from Flamingo Casino Club\u2019s website describing the financial perks to retail investors. Source: Flamingo Casino Club In addition to this murky money trail, the purported partnership with the Flamingo Las Vegas, a well-established casino located on the Strip, was also fabricated, Rotunda said. The cease-and-desist order says Flamingo Casino Club's \"representations are false,\" and the Las Vegas casino denies any relationship. But the phony partnerships don't end there, according to the order. Flamingo Casino Club touts affiliations with Yahoo and MarketWatch, but there's no evidence substantiating any relationship with these businesses, the order says. \"Flamingo Casino Club is not providing purchasers with any information reflecting any type of relationship with either Yahoo or MarketWatch,\" the order says, adding that the casino provided hyperlinks to press releases distributed to Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch. In its promotional video, Flamingo Casino Club announced plans to build the virtual casino on the metaverse platform The Sandbox, but nothing's been built yet. The casino's leadership team wrote on Instagram that it delayed purchasing digital land because of ongoing negotiations with Snoop Dogg, who owns portions of the Sandbox property it plans to build on, according to the order and the casino's own social media posts. The order said the casino is \"intentionally failing to disclose the status of negotiations for purchasing virtual land from Snoop Dogg\" as well as \"the anticipated or projected cost of purchasing the virtual land.\" Through a series of subpoenas, regulators discovered that the IP address for Flamingo Casino Club's desktop computer and mobile device are registered to Moscow, further diminishing the chances of investors seeing any returns. \"Investors have to chase those ghosts to try to recover. And they're not going to recover if the money is going to Moscow,\" Rotunda said. Additionally, Rotunda said that the casino operators started mobilizing Flamingo Casino Club right around the time that Russia invaded Ukraine and that they later told investors some profits from their NFT sales would be donated to Ukrainian victims. \"And they didn't just talk about how they were going to donate to Ukrainian civilians to one person or two people, they publicly proclaimed it,\" Rotunda said. \"I haven't seen any money going to benefit Ukrainians.\""

TerraUSD, or UST, plunged to as low as 26 cents. The so-called stablecoin is meant to maintain a 1-to-1 peg with the U.S. dollar. It was last trading at around 68 cents, according to Coin Metrics data. Sister token luna, which has a floating price and is meant to serve as a kind of shock absorber for UST, at one point dived to less than 90 cents before recovering slightly to $1.18. The coin has lost roughly 96% of its value in the past seven days, and now has a smaller market value than its stablecoin counterpart. Blue-chip tokens bitcoin and ether saw wild swings throughout the day as traders monitored UST's descent as well as hotter-than-expected April inflation data. Bitcoin was last up 1% at $31,377, having previously slumped below $30,000. Ether fell 1% to $2,309. Stablecoins are akin to bank accounts for the crypto economy, offering a sound store of value to avoid the kind of volatility cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have become notorious for \u2014 in theory, at least. UST is what's known as an \"algorithmic\" stablecoin. It uses a complex system of minting and burning tokens to adjust supply and stabilize prices. UST's price has crumbled under the pressure of a sell-off in cryptocurrencies recently, resulting in further panic in the market. watch now VIDEO8:1008:10 What you should know before investing in crypto International Digital Originals Do Kwon, the coin's creator, made a last-ditch effort to return UST to its $1 peg by increasing the rate at which new luna is minted per day. The venture is essentially allowing supply of its stablecoin to be eaten up, a move it hopes will boost the price. \"I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you - know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this,\" Kwon tweeted Wednesday. Investors had hoped for a fresh capital injection to boost the project. Backers of UST are reportedly seeking to raise more than $1 billion in funding to prop up the stablecoin. Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, said Kwon's announcement did not inspire confidence. \"They're letting the system bleed out in the hope that it will start re-pegging back when the 'excess' UST supply has been worn out,\" Ayyar said. Kwon has amassed billions of dollars' worth of bitcoin through his Luna Foundation Guard fund to support UST in times of crisis. The fear now is that Luna Foundation Guard dumps those bitcoins onto the market, resulting in an even bigger sell-off. Bitcoin briefly slumped below $30,000 Wednesday, the second time in a week it has fallen beneath that level. The world's biggest cryptocurrency is down over 50% since its November all-time high, as investors flee risky assets amid fears over rising inflation and slowing economic growth. Algorithmic stablecoins are still a relatively new phenomenon. But UST has grown to become a major player in the crypto economy, with a circulating supply of 16 billion tokens.

        "detailedArticleContent": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNT Pedestrians walk past a display of cryptocurrency Bitcoin on February 15, 2022 in Hong Kong, China. Anthony Kwan | Getty Images A multibillion-dollar bet that bitcoin can act as a \"reserve currency\" for the crypto economy is already being tested as UST, a controversial stablecoin, struggles to maintain its $1 peg. UST dropped close to 99 cents over the weekend, fueling fears of a potential \"bank run\" that could force Terra, the project behind it, to dip into a $3.5 billion pile of bitcoin to support the token. Now, the Luna Foundation Guard, an organization created by Terra's inventor Do Kwon, says it will lend out $750 million in bitcoin to trading firms to hold UST's price peg. But that's done little to assuage investors' concerns about the implications for bitcoin. What is UST? Developed by Singapore-based Terraform Labs, UST is what's known as an algorithmic stablecoin. It aims to carry out the function of stablecoins like tether, which track the price of the U.S. dollar, but without any actual cash held in a reserve to back it. Instead, UST \u2014 or \"terraUSD\" \u2014 is created by destroying a sister token, known as luna, using smart contracts, lines of code written into the blockchain. \"If you've got, say, $405, and you burn one luna, you should be able to mint 405 of the UST stablecoin,\" Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex, explains. The same applies vice versa \u2014 new luna is minted by burning UST and other algorithmic stablecoins that Terra supports. Terra's protocols also feature an arbitrage mechanism, where investors can exploit deviating prices in each of the tokens. For example, too much demand for UST may result in its price topping $1. That means traders can convert $1 worth of luna into UST, and pocket the difference as profit. The model is designed to even out supply and demand for UST. When the price of UST is too high, users are incentivized to burn luna and create new UST, increasing the stablecoin's supply while also decreasing the amount of luna in circulation. \"The luna becomes more scarce, which makes it more valuable, transferring that value into UST,\" Alexander says. When UST's price is too low, the reverse happens \u2014 UST gets burned and luna is minted. That should, in theory, help stabilize prices. The problem \"This assumes normal market conditions,\" said David Moreno Darocas, a research analyst at CryptoCompare. \"During periods of high volatility and one-sided buy\/sell activity for UST, the above stabilizer may not be sufficient to maintain the peg in the short-term.\" There have been multiple instances where UST has decoupled from its $1 peg, raising concerns about the viability of its economic model \u2014 particularly in a situation when several people try to redeem their tokens at once. The latest challenge arrived over the weekend. Hundreds of millions of UST was sold on Anchor, Terra's flagship lending platform, as well as Curve and Binance, resulting in accusations of a \"coordinated attack\" on the stablecoin. \"Men will literally attack a stablecoin unsuccessfully instead of going to therapy,\" Do Kwon, the South Korean crypto entrepreneur who co-founded Terraform Labs, said in a since-deleted tweet. watch now VIDEO2:2102:21 How this crypto fund outperformed bitcoin for the last five years Crypto World 'Reserve currency' To address concerns over the sustainability of the stablecoin, Kwon plans to buy up to $10 billion worth of bitcoin through a nonprofit called Luna Foundation Guard. These funds would provide a backstop in case of a dramatic fall in the value of UST. The idea is that bitcoin would act as the \"reserve currency\" for the Terra ecosystem, similar to how central banks hold large quantities of dollars in their foreign exchange reserves. LFG bought another $1.5 billion in bitcoin last week, taking its total reserves to about $3.5 billion. However, on Monday, the organization said it is taking steps to \"proactively defend the stability\" of UST. That includes lending $750 million worth of bitcoin to trading firms to \"protect the UST peg.\" and a further 750 million in UST being lent out to buy more bitcoin \"as market conditions normalize.\" \"In the case of most of these algo stablecoins, we have seen that the teams behind the project usually need to step in \u2014 so these are not fully decentralized or managed independently yet,\" said Vijay Ayyar, head of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. What it means for bitcoin Investors are worried that UST's bitcoin underpinning will result in further pain for the cryptocurrency. The world's largest digital coin dropped below $33,000 on Monday, slumping to its lowest level since July 2021. It was last trading at about $32,921, down 6% in the last 24 hours. LFG's intervention \"will add to the selling pressure,\" said Derek Lim, head of crypto insights at the Bybit exchange. \"BTC will likely go lower before it bounces back when short-sellers take profit.\" Kwon insisted LFG is \"not trying to exit its bitcoin position.\" \"As markets recover, we plan to have the loan redeemed to us in BTC, increasing the size of our total reserves,\" he said. The plan is to eventually allow UST holders to redeem their tokens in exchange for bitcoin. Bitcoin would play the role normally taken by luna in a crisis scenario, with arbitrageurs buying UST and then swapping it for discounted bitcoin. But this is still weeks away from being implemented, and it's unclear how it would work in practice. The biggest risk moving forward would be another depegging of UST forcing LFG to liquidate its bitcoin holdings, said Hendo Verbeek, head of quantitative trading operations at Faculty Group. That could, in turn, result in further liquidations of \"over-leveraged\" buyers, according to Verbeek. \"This is a nightmare scenario which looks like a real outcome of events,\" he said. watch now VIDEO8:0808:08 Can crypto clean up its dirty image?

Now, the governor of the U.S. state with the largest economy is joining the party. California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Wednesday on cryptocurrencies, laying out a road map for regulatory and consumer protections and examining ways the state can take advantage of blockchain technologies and digital assets. \"Of the 800 blockchain businesses in North America, about a quarter of them are in California, dramatically more than any other state,\" Dee Dee Myers, senior advisor to Newsom and director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, told CNBC. \"We've heard from so many that they want to be here, and we want to help them do that responsibly.\" Newsom is directing the state's business and economic development office to work in collaboration with California's Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency and the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. The order is designed to \"create a transparent and consistent business environment for companies operating in blockchain, including crypto assets and related financial technologies, that harmonizes federal and California laws, balances the benefits and risks to consumers, and incorporates California values, such as equity, inclusivity, and environmental protection.\" Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Bitcoin over the past year CNBC The agencies will submit its findings and recommend next steps.

We can use it to protect people's identity and provide benefits to people through government services. If we're selling carbon offsets, we can make sure the same forest isn't being sold twice and that there's some record that's transparent.\" Under California's plan, the order would align with the Biden administration's proposal in March to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies.

In February, New Hampshire issued an executive order to propose new bitcoin laws. watch now VIDEO5:4905:49 Bitcoin gets a bump as Biden signs crypto executive order Fast Money Aaron Klein, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the most compelling part of Newsom's plan is the exploration of ways to find \"crypto solutions to existing problems.\" \"California seems to be trying to walk a tightrope between moving the state forward to embrace new technology while making sure that consumers and investors are properly protected,\" Klein said. Newsom is sure to encounter skeptics, given concerns about the security of crypto and the speculative money that's poured into digital assets. Criminals stole a record $14 billion worth of cryptocurrency last year, according to a report by data firm Chainalysis, and the SEC announced Tuesday that it will almost double its staff responsible for protecting investors in crypto markets. \"Blockchain has been around for decades, it has never found a widespread adoption use case,\" said Stephen Diamond, a law professor at Santa Clara University. \"There's a mania underway and for the state of California to come in and essentially say this has huge potential, to me, they're feeding the mania.\" Myers said it's critical to put in place \"guardrails\" to eliminate the ability for bad actors to maneuver and to \"make sure there are enforceable and clear guidelines to protect everybody.\" Timothy Massad, former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said it's important to get states and government agencies on the same page. \"What we would not want to see is a situation where states are competing with one another to attract businesses by either lowering standards or providing incentives,\" Massad said.

Crypto BODEN, Sweden \u2014 Tucked away in snowy Swedish Lapland is a modern-day gold mine. But instead of picks and shovels, it's filled with thousands of computers. These machines, known as mining rigs, are working around the clock to find new units of cryptocurrency \u2014 in this case, ethereum, the second-largest token globally. To do so, they must compete with others around the world to find the answer to a complex math puzzle, which grows in difficulty as more and more computers, known as \"miners,\" join the network.

Benjamin Hall | CNBC The whole process is underpinned by something known as \"proof of work.\" And it uses up an incredibly large amount of energy. Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital currency, also uses this framework. It now consumes as much energy as entire countries. Governments around the world are growing concerned. Some countries, such as China, have gone so far as to ban crypto mining outright. Switching to renewables The mine in question, a warehouse-like building located in the military town of Boden, houses 15,000 of these mining rigs in total. At 86,000 square feet, it's bigger than a standard soccer pitch. The facility is run by Hive Blockchain, a Canadian firm that focuses on using green and renewable energy to mine crypto. At 86,000 square feet, Hive's Swedish mining facility is bigger than a standard soccer pitch. Benjamin Hall | CNBC Hive's Swedish operation is powered by a local hydropower plant in Boden, in the north of the country. The region is renowned for its surplus of cheap, renewable electricity. \"In the north of Sweden, 100% of the power is either hydro power-based or wind power-based,\" Johan Eriksson, an advisor at Hive, said. \"It is 100% renewable.\" Eriksson says crypto miners are using excess energy capacity that would have otherwise been wasted \u2014 in other words, it's not required by households in the region. But the vast amount of power needed to run operations like Hive's has alarmed officials. Finansinspektionen, the Swedish finance watchdog, is calling on the European Union to ban crypto mining due to its huge energy usage. \"Extensive usage of renewable energy for crypto-asset mining could jeopardize Sweden's climate goals,\" Victoria Ericsson, a spokeswoman for the agency, told CNBC. These machines, known as mining rigs, work round the clock to find new units of cryptocurrency. Benjamin Hall | CNBC Development of electric vehicles, batteries and fossil-free steel should take priority over crypto mining, she said. \"There are alternative consensus mechanisms to proof of work available that would significantly reduce the energy consumption,\" Ericsson added. \"We do not regard it as reasonable to exclude Bitcoin and the crypto world from the work being undertaken by other sectors of the economy to improve energy efficiency.\" Is decarbonization enough? Edinburgh-based crypto firm Zumo is part of the Crypto Climate Accord, a coalition of companies that aims to achieve net-zero emissions in the crypto industry by 2030. Kirsteen Harrison, Zumo's climate policy advisor, says the initiative is working on a piece of software that would be able to verify the source of energy used in mining crypto as renewable. \"There's quite a lot of trials going on with that at the moment,\" she said. \"If that's successful, then hopefully that will filter out to the rest of the sector.\" Simply decarbonizing the production of cryptocurrencies may not be enough though, according to some activists. watch now VIDEO11:3711:37 Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king? Crypto Greenpeace and other environmental groups are calling for the bitcoin community to replace its proof of work mechanism with one called \"proof of stake\" instead. That would remove the huge computational cost of verifying new crypto transactions. Ethereum is currently in the middle of a lengthy transition to proof of stake, a move advocates say would reduce its energy consumption by over 99%. And other cryptos, like cardano and solan, already operate on proof of stake networks. But, as Harrison explains, moving a cryptocurrency like bitcoin away from proof of work is easier said than done. \"I don't believe that there's an option to do away with proof of work, precisely because not one single player has control of the system,\" she says. Not everyone's on board Although Hive and other crypto firms are increasingly turning to green energy to fuel their operations, there are plenty of others who aren't yet on board with the shift to renewables. watch now VIDEO12:5012:50 How Wall Street learned to love bitcoin Crypto Some are deliberately using gas that would otherwise be flared to generate electricity for crypto mining, for example. Since China banned crypto mining, bitcoin's backers had hoped this would make the cryptocurrency greener. But a peer-reviewed study released in February found bitcoin mining only got dirtier in 2021, with miners actually flocking to regions that more reliant on coal and other fossil fuels, including Kazakhstan and southern U.S. states like Texas and Kentucky. Part of the problem is the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. While there are various groups now claiming to represent the industry, bitcoin has no central authority and anyone can participate in the network."

Some fairly large names have set up shop in Gibraltar and obtained licenses from local regulators, including FTX, Huobi and Bullish, which is backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. Executives from Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, also visited Gibraltar \"some months back,\" but does not have a license, Isola said. The company is seeking to become a friend rather than foe to regulators after facing crackdowns in numerous countries last year. The Gibraltar Stock Exchange recently agreed to be acquired by Valereum, a blockchain firm, in a bid to become the world's first regulated bourse for share and crypto trading. It's an aim Switzerland's SIX Swiss Exchange is also seeking to achieve with the creation of an exchange for trading blockchain-based securities. The latest rules arrive as various major world economies, including the U.S. and U.K., are now introducing new rules to bring crypto into the regulatory fold. \"I think it's a sign that more and more jurisdictions are recognizing the need to do it,\" Isola said. \"And the need to do it is because there's more and more adoption.\" However, Isola insisted Gibraltar is \"not doing this to market ourselves,\" adding: \"We want a very small but quality number of firms within our jurisdiction.\" Transparency Gibraltar has previously been criticized for being a \"tax haven.\" Several major U.K. gambling firms, including Entain and 888, set up shop in the rocky peninsula, in part due to its favorable taxation regime. More recently, however, Gibraltar has sought to distance itself from such a reputation. The region is \"fully compliant with all transparency and exchange of information standards applicable in the U.K.,\" Isola said, adding this was at odds with descriptions of Gibraltar as a tax haven. Such transparency standards also apply to crypto, Isola added, meaning \"the bar to entry is high.\" Spain last year agreed to take Gibraltar off its list of tax havens after coming to a tax cooperation deal with the U.K. The issue has been a sticking point in London's negotiations with Madrid following Britain's withdrawal from the EU."

Kraken will become the first cryptocurrency exchange to offer direct funding and trading in UAE dirhams against bitcoin, ether and a range of other virtual assets, after gaining regulatory approval from the ADGM and Financial Services Regulatory Authority for its local launch. \"For us, it's really important to facilitate access to global markets and global liquidity by making sure that investors and traders in the region have access to local currencies,\" Ting said.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Sanctions imposed on Russia over the country's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine could hamper the growth of its multibillion-dollar crypto sector, according to experts. This week, U.S. officials targeted Russian bitcoin mining firm BitRiver in its latest round of sanctions aimed at hurting Russia's economy. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control says it is concerned Russia may monetize its vast oil reserves and other natural resources with power-intensive crypto mining as a way to raise funds and get around western sanctions. \"This is a powerful signal from OFAC that it will use every tool in its arsenal to prevent Russia from evading sanctions through crypto,\" David Carlisle, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at crypto compliance firm Elliptic, said in an emailed note. The sanctions will cripple BitRiver and its various subsidiaries, blocking them from accessing U.S. crypto exchanges or mining equipment. Crypto mining \u2014 the process of validating new digital currency transactions \u2014 requires specialized computers that consume lots of energy. The move shows U.S. officials are \"deeply concerned that Russia could leverage its natural resources to conduct crypto mining to evade sanctions,\" something Iran and North Korea have been known to engage in the past, Carlisle said. The potential exploitation of bitcoin production for Russian sanctions evasion remains a key concern for global regulators, including the International Monetary Fund. watch now VIDEO12:5012:50 How Wall Street learned to love bitcoin Crypto \"Crypto mining, while nowhere near a replacement for the assets frozen by Russian sanctions, avoids the fiat-to-crypto 'on-ramps' and crypto-to-fiat 'off-ramps' at centralized virtual currency exchanges, thereby bypassing sanctions screening,\" said Anand Sithian, counsel at Crowell & Moring and a former trial attorney in the criminal division of the Department of Justice's asset forfeiture and money-laundering section. Russia's crypto market Separately, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, said it is limiting its service for Russian users in response to the fifth wave of EU sanctions on Moscow. Russian Binance accounts with over 10,000 euros in digital currency will be prevented from making deposits or trades and can only withdraw funds, the company said. \"While these measures are potentially restrictive to normal Russian citizens, Binance must continue to lead the industry in implementing these sanctions,\" Binance said in an update on its website. \"We believe all other major exchanges must follow the same rules soon.\" Russia is home to a huge cryptocurrency market. The Kremlin estimates that Russians own roughly 10 trillion rubles ($124 billion) worth of digital assets. It's not clear where this data comes from, but there is growing evidence that Russians are turning to crypto as an alternative to the ruble as the currency crashes in response to the country's economic isolation. According to data from CryptoCompare, ruble-denominated crypto trading volumes reached 111.4 billion rubles ($1.4 billion) in March, much higher than in earlier months. Activity has dipped in April, with total month-to-date volume reaching only 19.2 billion rubles. Binance was the most popular exchange for ruble-crypto volume in March, accounting for 77% of trades. In the six months ending March 2022, ruble-crypto trading volume topped 420 billion rubles, or more than $5 billion, according to CryptoCompare. Third-biggest bitcoin mining hub Meanwhile, Cambridge University figures show the country is a powerhouse in the field of crypto mining. In August 2021, Russia accounted for about 11% of the global processing power used for minting new units of bitcoin, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, making it the third-biggest mining hub behind Kazakhstan. Given Kazakhstan's political unrest led to internet shutdowns that knocked bitcoin miners offline, there's a chance Russia's share of the sector may be even higher now. However, there could end up being an exodus of miners from Russia to the \"stans\" \u2014 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan \u2014 where they may \"utilize stranded gas to power their operations,\" Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare, told CNBC. The Russian government has a \"love-hate relationship\" with digital assets, Hayter said. While Russia's central bank is pushing for a ban on the use and mining of cryptocurrencies, President Vladimir Putin wants to regulate them instead. According to Hayter, the Russian regime and its oligarchs \"might see digital assets as a way to fund activities outside of Russia.\""

In this case, Binance launched an emoji for several hashtags, including #Binance, #BNB and #BitcoinButton. The associated emoji for these hashtags depicted a block with Binance's logo surrounded by four pixelated arms each bent at a right angle, similar to the swastika symbol. Twitter users were quick to pick up on its resemblance to a swastika. \"The new Binance logo is a literal swastika emoji,\" one user wrote.

The bosses of several major crypto companies told CNBC regulators are beginning to take a more positive approach to digital currencies, following a numerous crackdowns targeting the space. Whereas China has banned crypto outright, countries like the U.S. and Britain have announced moves to bring regulatory oversight to the nascent market. \"The tide is definitely turning,\" Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, told CNBC on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week Summit. Last year, U.K. regulators barred Binance from undertaking any regulated activity in the country, while in Singapore, Binance limited its services after the central bank warned it may be in violation of local regulation. In a speech kicking off the event Wednesday, Zhao said regulatory discussions around crypto have shifted from \"negative\" to \"positive.\" Before Zhao was introduced, the MC for the event referenced the crypto slang term \"wagmi,\" which stands for \"we're all gonna make it.\" \"To be honest, I feel we kind of did make it,\" he said, adding crypto serves as a lifeline for some in Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. But the crypto world still has some way to go before reaching widespread acceptance. And the fate of the industry largely hinges on the approaches that will be taken by different global regulators.

In the U.S., President Joe Biden recently signed an executive order urging government-wide coordination on digital assets. A key concern for Western regulators, industry insiders say, is the use of digital assets for Russian sanctions evasion. \"I think they're starting to take it seriously [but] I don't think they're getting a warm and fuzzy feeling about it,\" Arthur Breitman, a co-founder of Tezos, a blockchain protocol rivalling Ethereum, told CNBC. watch now VIDEO6:4406:44 Celsius CEO on best practices for retail investing in cryptocurrencies Squawk Box Europe \"Naturally, they are going to have a conservative bias,\" Breitman said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has taken Ripple, Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen to court over allegations they illegally sold over $1 billion worth of the cryptocurrency XRP. The SEC contends XRP should be considered a security, a claim that Ripple disputes. \"When I give advice to entrepreneurs that are thinking about building a crypto or blockchain company, I tell them do not incorporate in the United States,\" Garlinghouse said. \"The lack of clarity and a lack of certainty means that you are at risk for the exact kind of lawsuit the SEC brought against us.\" Ripple is even considering moving its headquarters abroad, with London and Singapore among the potential candidates. \"Ripple will hire north of 300 people this year, and more than half of them will be outside the United States,\" Garlinghouse said."

From first-year analysts to senior management and managing directors, there's a greater interest in making the move to crypto, he said. A 'Wall St' sign is seen above two 'One Way' signs in New York. Lucas Jackson | Reuters Financial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015, according to recent data from LinkedIn. In the first half of 2021, that pace jumped by 40%. Banks on a crypto hiring spree included Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One, Barclays, Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America and BNY Mellon. The crypto boom on Wall Street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start-up world. Crypto and blockchain companies raised a record $25 billion last year, an eightfold increase from a year earlier, according to CB Insights data. Farooq said that even with the start-up boom, JPMorgan has seen \"limited attrition.\" Those leaving have been people \"wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar.\" However, JPMorgan did lose one of its highest-profile crypto deputies last year. Christine Moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at Onyx. She has yet to announce her next move. \"After over a half-decade laying the foundations for blockchain-based infrastructure across financial markets and cross-border payments, creating new businesses that have already scaled into the $USD billions at J.P. Morgan, I am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the Web3\/crypto ecosystem from a new angle,\" Moy told CNBC in an email. Leaving Wall Street Other top crypto executives who left Wall Street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution. Mary Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, left her job as a managing director at BlackRock last year. Her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company. \"It certainly wasn't my primary job,\" Lader said. \"It was kind of a hobby, as it is for so many people on Wall Street, and it definitely wasn't something that at the time I was thinking about, because it was early stages of adoption.\" watch now VIDEO18:3818:38 Uniswap's Mary-Catherine Lader explains why she left BlackRock for crypto Crypto World At Uniswap, Lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. She said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation. \"This technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn't feel like a risk at all,\" Lader said. \"I was sad to leave the people I had loved working with for many years. I have tremendous respect for the firm, but it didn't feel like a risk. That's a great thing about where we are in Web3.\" Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs, made a similar career change last year. He joined institutional crypto trading platform Talos and described the risk in a similar way, calling the decision \"multidimensional.\" \"Inherently, you're taking a brand risk \u2014 Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street,\" Schmidt said. \"You are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional, and I very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there's a generational opportunity here.\" Cryptocurrency start-ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent. Many are looking beyond top candidates with MBAs, and instead considering those with less conventional resumes. Lader and Schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self-taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on Twitter. \"I constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old, who are as smart about markets as people I worked with on Wall Street for years,\" Lader said. \"People who frankly had no interest in financial services, who would never really explore or consider working on Wall Street, are excited to work at UniSwap Labs and companies like us.\""

Matt Cardy | Getty Images LONDON \u2014 A slew of cryptocurrency companies could be forced to wind down their business in the U.K. if they fail to register with the finance watchdog ahead of a key deadline next week. From Mar. 31, firms operating crypto services in Britain must be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, which is tasked with overseeing how digital asset firms combat money laundering. Last year, the regulator extended the deadline allowing firms on a temporary register to continue trading while they sought full authorization \u2014 it'll close once the deadline passes. The FCA said many crypto companies had withdrawn their applications as they were not meeting the required anti-money laundering standards. Now, with just days to go until the new deadline elapses, the fate of firms on the temporary register \u2014 including $33 billion fintech firm Revolut and Copper, a crypto start-up that counts former U.K. Finance Minister Philip Hammond as an advisor \u2014 hangs in the balance. 'A total disaster' Many industry insiders have expressed frustration with the FCA's handling of the crypto register. One lawyer advising crypto companies on their applications said the regulator had been slow to approve applications and was often unresponsive, a sentiment echoed by other figures in the sector. \"The process has been a total disaster from the FCA's side of things,\" the lawyer told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter. watch now VIDEO12:5012:50 How Wall Street learned to love bitcoin Crypto An FCA spokesperson said it has approved just 33 crypto firms' applications so far. More than 80% of the firms it has assessed to date have either withdrawn their applications or been rejected. \"We've seen a high number of the cryptoasset businesses applying for registration not meeting standards there to help ensure firms are not used to transfer and or disguise criminal funds,\" the spokesperson said. \"Firms that do not meet the expected benchmark can withdraw their application. Firms that decide not to withdraw have the right to appeal our decision to refuse, including through the courts.\" Why it matters Gemini, the crypto exchange operated by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, was among the first firms to get approved by the FCA. Blair Halliday, Gemini's head of U.K., said the licensing regime is important as it provides customers the assurance that they're dealing with a firm that has undergone rigorous scrutiny. \"Getting a crypto asset registration in place was a critical step for crypto in this country,\" Halliday told CNBC. \"It gave firms that really have that desire to seek regulatory approvals something to demonstrate as a key differentiator.\" Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC Pro This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia?

And some companies are still withdrawing their applications. That includes B2C2, the London-based crypto trading firm, which recently withdrew from the FCA's temporary register. Since Monday, all of B2C2's spot trading activity has shifted to the company's U.S. entity. The firm said its derivatives business is unaffected as it is handled by an FCA-authorized subsidiary. \"We are committed to ensuring this move causes as little disruption as possible and are working closely with our clients to ensure they continue to have a seamless trading experience with us,\" a B2C2 spokeswoman told CNBC via Telegram. Firms that have had their applications rejected by the FCA can appeal, but the process is a long one and could need to go through the courts. A tribunal recently sided with the FCA's decision to refuse an application from the crypto exchange Gidiplus. Brexit dividend?

Crypto President Joe Biden has signed an executive order calling for coordination from the government on oversight of digital currencies, while EU lawmakers recently voted down a proposal that would have effectively banned bitcoin mining in the bloc. \"While major jurisdictions are spotting the opportunity and the risk, the U.K. is emphasising the risk,\" Magaldi told CNBC. \"By moving too fast and too narrow, rules and timeframes create hurdles to crypto firms that could potentially displace them from the U.K. market.\" Industry representatives fear this could put the U.K. at a disadvantage at a time when it is vying to be a global leader in financial innovation post-Brexit. The country is home to a thriving fintech industry, attracting nearly $12 billion in investment last year. But fast-growing fintechs like Revolut and Copper may soon be forced to wind down their crypto activities in Britain and move offshore if they don't make it onto the full register. Both companies declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. Firms like PayPal and Coinbase, which sell crypto services in the U.K. through overseas subsidiaries, will be unaffected."

        "detailedArticleContent": "watch now VIDEO36:2436:24 Crypto investor Katie Haun shatters records with new $1.5 billion fund: CNBC Crypto World Crypto World Crypto investor Katie Haun has raised $1.5 billion for her new fund after leaving Andreessen Horowitz, and shattered a record in the process. Haun Ventures' kickoff marks the largest debut venture fund ever raised by a solo female founding partner, according to Pitchbook. Former investment banker Mary Meeker held the prior record with a $1.3 billion fund after spinning out from Kleiner Perkins. \"It feels, honestly, like a lot of pressure. But I think that motivates everyone on the team,\" Haun told CNBC in her first broadcast interview since leaving Andreessen Horowitz. \"Web3 is the new era of the internet, and it deserves a new era of investors.\" The term Web3, or Web 3.0, loosely refers to general computing applications built on the blockchain \u2014 the same technology underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Examples include NFTs, which are traceable ownership certificates attached to digital files such as art pieces or videos, and decentralized finance applications, in which self-executing \"smart\" contracts can be used to replace middlemen like lawyers and bankers in certain types of transactions. But overall, the space is still in a very early and experimental phase. Haun Ventures will invest in both start-up equity, and in some cases the cryptocurrencies issued by those start-ups, also known as tokens. \"That's something I've learned through being involved in deploying three other crypto funds: there's still a ton of potential in crypto and Web3 equity business models, but also token business models,\" she said. \"I don't think that you can really be a crypto investor without holding tokens.\" Katie Haun, Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Source: CNBC Haun's fund will be divvied up into two segments: $500 million for early-stage companies and protocols, and $1 billion for \"acceleration,\" or later-stage projects. Haun, a former federal prosecutor, became Andreessen's first female general partner in 2018 where she co-led its multiple cryptocurrency funds alongside Chris Dixon. Andreessen Horowitz will be a limited partner in Haun's newest fund, while Marc Andreessen, the firm's founder, and Dixon all personally contributed to her new endeavor. Her exit caught many in Silicon Valley off guard. While it was a \"dream job,\" Haun said the departure was about taking more of a risk, and \"stepping out of her comfort zone.\" \"Obviously there's a relationship there, and there are friendships there. We still intend to collaborate closely with Andreessen Horowitz,\" she said. \"One of the unique things about our fund size makes it so that we don't have to lead every deal, we can play well with a lot of other crypto investors -- founders don't want a single investor on their cap table, even in the early rounds.\" Haun Ventures' nine-person team includes Chris Lehane, a former Airbnb executive and Clinton administration official, Tomicah Tillemann, a former staffer for President Joe Biden, and Rachael Horwitz, who led communications teams at Twitter, Google, Facebook and Coinbase. Multiple employees left Andreessen Horowitz with Haun for the new fund. She said the smaller team allows the firm to be more \"nimble,\" and act as \"venture contributors\" in addition to venture capitalists. \"Gone are the days where founders just want capital,\" she said. \"One of the things that Haun Ventures will do for our founders is really actively contribute to the projects in which we invest.\" The launch comes during a bear market for bitcoin. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down roughly 40% from its peak in November, with smaller cryptocurrencies like ether seeing deeper losses. Haun, who has invested through past downturns or \"crypto winters\", said there's still plenty of developer activity and upside. \"When I think back to deploying the first two crypto funds, that was during a period of immense volatility -- it was definitely a crypto winter with prices down 70% and projects were still born that during that cycle,\" she said, highlighting Solana and NFT exchange OpenSea. \"One of the things I've learned as an investor with a long term view of the space, is that great products are going to be built and great protocols are going to be built, no matter what the prices are.\" Crypto exchange Coinbase, which Haun is on the board of, has seen roughly 58% from drop its high last year. Still, Haun said private start-up valuations aren't being affected, yet. \"There's a bit of a lag. We're still seeing very high valuations in crypto projects. Last time this happened, with macro market corrections, it took a while for that to translate over into crypto. I think the same could be true here,\" she said. While cryptocurrencies may be struggling to regain momentum, dollars flowing into private companies is at all-time highs. Blockchain start-ups brought in a record $25 billion in venture capital dollars last year, according to recent data from CB Insights. That figure is up eightfold from a year earlier. That flood of venture dollars has sparked some controversy on Twitter. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey \u2060\u2014 two of the world's best-known tech billionaires \u2060\u2014 have been among those questioning \"Web3.\" Dorsey argues VCs and their limited partners are the ones who will ultimately end up owning Web3 and it \"will never escape their incentives,\" he tweeted, calling it a \"centralized entity with a different label.\" \"I look at it as Web3 finally getting some of the critics it deserves in the space,\" Haun said. \"If I could have the choice between Jack Dorsey offering some critiques versus some of the myths that we've heard perpetrated for so long in the space, I would certainly choose the former. So I think that debate is healthy.\""

        "detailedArticleContent": "Jacob Kupferman | Getty Images The National Football League, in a memo issued Tuesday, granted teams limited permission to seek blockchain sponsorships, a partial reversal from late last summer, as the technology grows in popularity among the organization's fans and athletes. The league said it made the decision to allow \"promotional relationships without undertaking excessive regulator or brand risk\" after it completed an evaluation of the technology. The updated team guidelines, which are subject to the NFL's approval, exclude stadium signage. For now, restrictions remain in place for specific cryptocurrencies and fan tokens, which can be exchanged for merchandise and experiences. \"Clubs will continue to be prohibited from directly promoting cryptocurrency,\" the memo reads. The NFL's decision also comes after its recent lobbying push related to blockchain. CNBC reported in February that the league lobbied the Securities and Exchange Commission on \"issues related to blockchain technology\" from July through December 2021. The NFL also lobbied the White House and the departments of Justice and Commerce. \"In this evolving regulatory environment, it remains essential that we proceed carefully when evaluating potential commercial opportunities involving blockchain technologies, and conduct appropriate diligence on all potential partners and their business models,\" the memo reads. The memo comes days ahead of the NFL's annual meetings, which start Saturday in Florida. The league will update team owners on business initiatives, including the revised blockchain guidelines. It's the first time the NFL will hold the meetings in person since 2019 due to the Covid pandemic. CNBC obtained a copy of the memo issued by NFL Chief Revenue Officer Renie Anderson and Chief Media and Business Officer Brian Rolapp. The update comes after the NFL and the players union struck a deal with blockchain company Dapper Labs to produce video collectibles. Panini has the league's NFT trading card rights. In addition, the NFL approved media partners to allow blockchain advertisements during its games for the first time during the 2021 season. Joe Ruggiero, the NFL's head of consumer products, told CNBC the team deals with blockchain companies will not exceed three years, \"so that it gives us flexibility for the long term.\" Ruggiero added the NFL could put its official blockchain rights on the marketplace, too. It's unclear how much the NFL would seek. CNBC previously reported that the National Basketball Association struck a deal with Coinbase worth $192 million over four years. Likewise, cryptocurrency platform FTX's $10 million pact with the NBA's Golden State Warriors could be a blueprint for potential deals between blockchain-linked companies and NFL teams under the newly issued guidance. \"We're extremely bullish on blockchain technology,\" Ruggiero said. \"We think that it has a lot of potential to really shape innovation, shape fan engagement over the course of the coming decade.\" Blockchain tech serves as digital ledgers similar and is used for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It also effectively gives virtual collectibles like nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, unique and nonhackable certificates of authenticity. Tuesday's memo also granted teams limited permissions on NFTs. Monitors display Coinbase signage during the company's initial public offering (IPO) at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, on Wednesday, April 14, 2021. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images \"Subject to League approval, Clubs may now accept advertising (without use of club marks and logos, unless in connection with a League NFT deal) for NFTs and NFT companies,\" the memo reads. Yet the league will continue to prohibit teams from \"engaging in product licensing arrangements or sponsorships for NFTs or NFT companies (other than as permitted in connection with League-level NFT partnerships),\" it adds. NFL stars such as Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski have capitalized on the blockchain marketplace with NFT deals. Brady's NFT platform, Autograph, raised $170 million in January, according to Bloomberg.

In October, CNBC reported Candy Digital is valued at $1.5 billion after a raise from investors, including NFL legend Peyton Manning. Ruggiero said the NFL would continue to evaluate its remaining restrictions on blockchain-related technologies. \"Everything is changing so quickly \u2013 we all have to be looking at the next areas of innovation,\" he said. \"So, we're spending a lot of time looking at where the future might go.\" watch now VIDEO13:2013:20 Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert discusses his new brand deal Sports"

Adam Jeffery | CNBC Blockchain start-up ConsenSys has raised $450 million in a new round of funding that more than doubles its valuation to $7 billion. The cash injection was led by ParaFi Capital, ConsenSys said Tuesday, with Microsoft, Japan's SoftBank and Singapore's Temasek also joining as new investors in the company. New York-headquartered ConsenSys was founded in 2014 by Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum. Ethereum is the blockchain platform behind ether, the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency. Whereas bitcoin is mostly used for transactions, Ethereum can be used to create decentralized applications, or dapps \u2014 think Facebook or TikTok, but on the blockchain, a shared record-keeping system for crypto transactions. ConsenSys develops software that runs on the Ethereum network. watch now VIDEO11:3711:37 Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king? Crypto It marks a rare crypto-related bet from Microsoft. The company previously led an early-stage investment in Palm NFT Studio, a start-up also co-founded by Lubin. Microsoft's involvement highlights growing interest from the world's largest tech firms in Web3, a loosely-defined term that refers to efforts to create a decentralized version of the internet based on blockchain technology. It's a term that has attracted a lot of chatter \u2014 and money \u2014 in Silicon Valley. Blockchain start-ups raised a record $25 billion in venture capital funding globally last year, according to CB Insights data. Other tech giants exploring Web3 include Facebook-parent Meta and Twitter. ConsenSys is viewed by investors as one of the companies that will power Web3. It's benefited from a flood of investment into emerging crypto trends such as decentralized finance, or DeFi, and nonfungible tokens, otherwise known as NFTs. The company's most popular products include the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet and Infura, a suite of tools that helps developers create Ethereum apps. MetaMask allows people to store and manage their tokens through a web browser extension or a mobile app. People can also access popular blockchain-powered apps like Uniswap and Axie Infinity. The bulk of ConsenSys' revenues currently comes from fees for trading different tokens on MetaMask.

The U.S., Philippines, Brazil, Germany and Nigeria are its most active markets. Infura, meanwhile, is used by over 430,000 developers and recently topped $1 trillion in annualized transaction volumes. ConsenSys said all the proceeds from its latest round would be converted into ether. The funds will go toward hiring 600 more employees, a redesign of MetaMask slated for release later this year, and building out ConsenSys' growing NFT business. Web3 hype Just as Web3 has generated a lot of hype, it's also drawn some notable critics, including tech billionaires Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey. Dorsey dismissed Web3 as a centralized technology owned by venture capitalists rather than the crypto community, while Musk says he thinks it's more \"buzzword\" than reality. For his part, Lubin doesn't see it that way. \"What Jack may be concerned about is how a small number of VCs are grabbing the lion's share of equity or tokens in many of the best projects,\" ConsenSys' CEO said. \"I'm not concerned at all.\" \"Decentralized protocol technology is anti-fragile, as is its global community,\" Lubin added. \"The community will interpret centralization as suboptimal and an opportunity, and will relentlessly decentralize.\" U.S. regulation The crypto world has also been keeping a close watch on regulatory developments out of the U.S., after President Joe Biden issued an executive order calling for a coordinated response from the government to industry oversight. Bitcoin, ether and other digital tokens initially reacted positively, only to subsequently turn south as investors grew concerned by a lack of detail in Biden's plan. The U.S. government \"has a big policy decision on its hands,\" Lubin said, adding ConsenSys \"is ready and eager to assist policymakers however we can.\" \"At the end of the day, permissionless blockchain networks are global, and they will grow and change our everyday lives whether or not the U.S. is a leader,\" he added."

Crypto Nonfungible.com's number for total NFT transactions in 2021 is lower than some other estimates. An earlier projection from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis put the figure at more than $40 billion. Zuppinger says this is down to the company's own methodology for measuring legitimate volumes of NFT trades. The Nonfungible.com data rules out transactions involving bots and wash trading, a practice where investors simultaneously buy and sell an asset to artificially inflate market activity. While proponents believe NFTs to be a valuable way of proving ownership of digital content, critics say the market has attracted predatory behavior. Participants are often encouraged to speculate on prices, and there's evidence emerging of their growing use for money laundering and other nefarious activities. Shift to the 'metaverse' More than 2.5 million crypto wallets belonged to people holding or trading NFTs in 2021, according to Nonfungible.com's research, up from just 89,000 a year earlier. The number of buyers rose to 2.3 million from 75,000. People also got better at making money from NFTs, according to the report, with investors generating a total of $5.4 billion in profits from sales of NFTs last year. Over 470 wallets managed to make profits in excess of $1 million, Nonfungible.com said. The most popular category of NFTs was collectibles, which accounted for $8.4 billion worth of sales. Gaming NFTs such as Axie Infinity represented the second-largest category, racking up $5.2 billion in sales. There was also a shift in focus later in the year to the so-called metaverse, with sales of digital land and other projects in the space reaching $514 million. watch now VIDEO12:5012:50 How Wall Street learned to love bitcoin Crypto Hype around the metaverse \u2014 proposed shared spaces in which users can interact with virtual objects and each other \u2014 gathered steam after Facebook's rebrand to Meta and Nike's purchase of RTFKT, which makes virtual sneakers. What next? Going forward, Zuppinger doesn't expect the overall value of NFT transactions to rise as dramatically this year. Volumes have averaged around $687 million per week so far in 2022, he said, slightly up from an average of $620 million a week in the fourth quarter of 2021. \"What is interesting is that we are seeing less people, less buyers, less sales,\" Zuppinger said. \"The global community may have decreased because of speculation and a loss of interest in collectibles. But the global market is still really high and the value of some of these assets has continued to increase.\" Zuppinger predicts more large companies and financial institutions will enter the market, while more speculative assets start to disappear. A number of big brands, including Visa and Nike, jumped on the NFT bandwagon in 2021."

It's a long-awaited directive that has had the crypto industry on edge, not least due to growing regulatory concern around the world surrounding the nascent digital asset market. There had been reports of a divide between White House officials and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen leading to delays in the policy rollout. The crypto market got wind of the executive order overnight after the Treasury accidentally put out a since-deleted statement calling it \"historic\" and releasing some of the details ahead of time. The order was finally signed Wednesday. It calls on federal agencies to take a unified approach to regulation and oversight of digital assets, according to a White House fact sheet. watch now VIDEO2:5602:56 White House economic advisor Brian Deese breaks down new executive order on crypto Squawk on the Street Here are the key things to know. Protecting consumers The measures announced Wednesday will focus on six key areas: Consumer and investor protection Financial stability Illicit activity U.S. competitiveness on a global stage Financial inclusion Responsible innovation Protecting consumers is an important part of the directive. There have been countless stories of investors falling for crypto scams, or losing huge sums of money through cyberattacks on exchanges or users themselves. The Biden administration is calling on the Treasury to assess and develop policy recommendations on crypto. It also wants regulators to \"ensure sufficient oversight and safeguard against any systemic financial risks posed by digital assets.\" watch now VIDEO12:5012:50 How Wall Street learned to love bitcoin Crypto While policymakers have been keen to downplay any systemic risks resulting from crypto, there have been increasing concerns over the role played by stablecoins. These are digital tokens that are meant to be pegged to the value of existing currencies like the U.S. dollar. Tether, the world's largest stablecoin with $80 billion in circulation, has attracted the ire of regulators over claims its token is not sufficiently backed by dollars held in reserve. Tether says its coin is fully backed, however the makeup of its reserves includes short-term debt obligations like commercial paper, not just cash. The topic of stablecoins was notably absent from the White House's announcement Wednesday, though Yellen has made clear she wants to see Congress introducing regulation for the sector. Illicit activity Another key area Biden's executive order focuses on is rooting out illegal activity in the crypto space. The president has called for an \"unprecedented focus of coordinated action\" from federal agencies in mitigating illicit finance and national security risks posed by cryptocurrencies. He is also urging international collaboration on the issue.

Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside Last month, U.S. officials seized $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin \u2014 their biggest seizure of cryptocurrencies ever \u2014 related to the 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, authorities are now also concerned about the possible use of crypto in helping sanctioned Russian individuals and companies evade the restrictions. Proponents of crypto say it is highly difficult for funds to be laundered through digital currency, however, as all transactions are kept public on an unchangeable record-keeping system known as the blockchain. Climate change It's a more subtle point, but Biden also dropped a mention of the sheer energy cost baked into digital currencies like bitcoin. He wants the government to study ways to make crypto innovation more \"responsible,\" reducing any negative climate impacts. watch now VIDEO8:4208:42 Why does bitcoin use so much energy? CNBC Explains Bitcoin relies on a mechanism known as proof of work to confirm transactions and generate new units of currency. A decentralized network of computers competes to solve complex math puzzles in order to mine the cryptocurrency. The more computing power a miner has, the higher their chances of being rewarded in new bitcoin. That has raised alarm bells for policymakers around the world, with China even banning crypto mining completely last year. That move led to an exodus of crypto miners from the country to the U.S. and other countries, such as Kazakhstan. U.S. competitiveness Part of the language in the White House announcement focuses on giving the U.S. a competitive edge over other countries when it comes to crypto development. This is especially significant now that China has effectively banned cryptocurrencies. Biden has tasked the Department of Commerce with \"establishing a framework to drive U.S. competitiveness and leadership in, and leveraging of digital asset technologies.\" watch now VIDEO11:3711:37 Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king? Crypto Several crypto industry figures have called for such action, including the bosses of Coinbase, Kraken and the Winklevoss twins' Gemini exchange. The Blockchain Association, an organization that represents multiple well-known crypto companies, said Wednesday that Biden \"has the opportunity to ensure America remains the global leader for technological innovation for years to come.\" Digital dollar Finally, the Biden administration also wants to explore a digital version of the dollar. It comes as China has led the charge toward central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, with more and more people using smartphones to make payments and handle their finances. Biden isn't saying whether the U.S. should launch its own digital currency. Rather, he's calling on the government to place \"urgency\" on research and development of a potential CBDC. The Federal Reserve last year began work on exploring the potential issuance of a digital dollar. The central bank released a long-awaited report detailing the pros and cons of such virtual money, but didn't take a position yet on whether it thinks the U.S. should issue one. While CBDCs could rapidly speed up the settlement of payments, policymakers are evaluating a number of issues around financial stability and privacy. 'Watershed moment' Delivery of the new policy agenda removes a key source of uncertainty for an industry that has already been rocked by numerous regulatory hiccups and scandals. Earlier this year, crypto start-up BlockFi was hit with a record $50 million fine by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it violated securities laws with its retail lending product. The penalty was part of a larger $100 million settlement which included payments to 32 states. Coinbase has similarly run into trouble with the watchdog, though it managed to avoid punishment. The SEC threatened Coinbase with legal action over a product similar to BlockFi's which offered users interest payments on their crypto holdings. The company subsequently dropped plans for the service. \"This is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996\/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet,\" Jeremy Allaire, CEO of crypto firm Circle, said on Twitter. Crypto investors appeared to agree. Prices of bitcoin surged above $42,000 Wednesday on optimism over the U.S. executive action. Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that the move by President Biden was an executive action."

        "detailedArticleContent": "File-sharing website LimeWire is relaunching in the form of a marketplace for nonfungible tokens. LimeWire LimeWire, the defunct file-sharing website, is set to make a comeback. The controversial service was shut down back in 2010, after a lengthy legal battle with the Recording Industry Association of America over allegations of music piracy. A federal judge found the platform caused copyright infringement on a \"massive scale.\" At its height, LimeWire was one of the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing websites, allowing users to download music and other content online free of charge. The likes of LimeWire, BitTorrent and Napster were eventually succeeded by subscription-based streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix. More than a decade since it closed down, LimeWire is making a comeback \u2014 but with a twist. The service will relaunch in May as a marketplace for trading nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, digital assets that keep a record of ownership for virtual items on the blockchain. Austrian brothers Julian and Paul Zehetmayr bought LimeWire's intellectual property and other assets last year. They say they've been planning to bring the platform back ever since. The new LimeWire will focus on music, letting users buy and trade rare items such as limited editions, unreleased demos and digital merchandise. watch now VIDEO11:3711:37 Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king? Crypto The platform will list prices in U.S. dollars, rather than crypto, and users will be able to purchase tokens using credit cards. Its payment functionality has been developed in partnership with the start-up Wyre. The company is counting on a more accessible approach to NFTs, as well as an advisory board that includes the manager of rap group Wu-Tang Clan, Tareef Michael, to attract users. \"The issue with the NFT market is that most platforms are decentralized,\" Julian Zehetmayr told CNBC. \"If you look at bitcoin, all the exchanges are making it really easy to buy, trade and sell bitcoin. There's no one really doing the same in the NFT space.\" \"We've obviously got this great mainstream brand that everybody's nostalgic about,\" he added. \"We thought we needed to build a real mainstream user experience as well.\" So far, LimeWire's revival has been funded with money the Zehetmayrs raised through the sale of their previous ventures. Their software firm Apilayer, for example, was bought by American holding company Idera last year. The brothers say they plan to raise additional capital through the launch of a LimeWire token, which will initially be sold to a select few investors ahead of a public sale later down the line. The token will grant holders the ability to vote on changes to LimeWire's policies as well as which artists are featured in its music charts. The Zehetmayrs say they're also considering a venture capital financing round later this year. Taming a 'Wild West' NFTs took off in a big way in 2021, with trading in the tokens reaching billions of dollars. The market has attracted everyone from crypto enthusiasts to celebrities, with a popular range of digital collectibles called the Bored Ape Yacht Club even making an appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\" Proponents of NFTs say they solve a key issue with the modern internet: namely, the unfettered distribution of media on the web, and a decline in compensation for artists and creators. However, others criticize the speculative nature of NFTs, which are often bought with the intention of flipping them at a higher price, as well as the number of scams in the space. Julian said there are \"lots of parallels\" between the NFT market today and LimeWire in the past, adding both are \"kind of a Wild West.\" \"We're trying to be a more mature platform and professionalize everything, just like Coinbase or other exchanges would do for crypto assets,\" he said. LimeWire isn't the first decentralized file-sharing service to turn to the world of cryptocurrencies. Rival company BitTorrent was acquired by crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun's start-up Tron in 2018."

Florian Gaertner | Photothek | Getty Images Executives at tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon are quitting to take jobs in the buzzy world of crypto. Blockchain platforms such as Polygon and Circle have hired top talent from Big Tech firms lately, enticing them with the pitch of working on the next \"big thing\" in tech \u2014 Web 3.0, or Web3. Ryan Wyatt left YouTube earlier this month to lead a new gaming studio from Polygon. Wyatt had joined the Google-owned video site back in 2014 to head up a push into video games content and compete more aggressively with Amazon's Twitch platform. \"When I started at YouTube Gaming almost eight years ago, I was the first person there,\" Wyatt told CNBC in an interview. \"We didn't have a team. People were really starting to show interest in gaming video.\" \"I look at this opportunity very much the same way,\" he added, describing the current stage of blockchain development as \"early\" and \"exciting.\" The buzz surrounding Web3 has attracted some of the brightest minds in tech. The Web3 movement proposes overhauling the internet in a way that would move popular online services over to decentralized technologies like blockchain. The list of Silicon Valley talent jumping ship for crypto also includes Sherice Torres, the former chief marketing officer of Facebook's crypto and payments unit, Novi. She was hired by Circle in January. And Amazon cloud exec Pravjit Tiwana fled to join crypto exchange Gemini as its chief technology officer. David Marcus, the former head of Novi, resigned late last year. While he's yet to unveil his next move, Marcus has been singing the praises of Web3 on Twitter. \"I've never felt this connected to a community of builders like the crypto\/web3 one,\" Marcus tweeted last month. Experts say tech executives are being drawn to the burgeoning industry in part due to its rapid growth. \"Naturally, people will want to work on what they view as the most exciting and innovative developments in the technology space, and currently, that is crypto and Web3,\" Alex Bouaziz, CEO and co-founder of payroll software firm Deel, told CNBC. \"Many are seeing it as the future of the tech industry, in the same way that Facebook and Amazon were attractive in the past.\" Potentially lucrative career move There's another thing that's attracting talent at Big Tech companies to Web3: money. According to data from Blind, a social network for tech professionals, bitcoin exchange Coinbase offers as much as $900,000 a year for software engineers. Investment into crypto companies has surged, meaning they've got much more cash to spare on lucrative compensation packages for big hires. Blockchain start-ups raised a record $25 billion in venture capital last year, according to CB Insight figures. Tech start-ups also typically let staff own a piece of their company through stock option schemes. With valuations for private crypto companies soaring, that means early employees could be in line for a big payout in the event of a takeover or initial public offering. And the trend doesn't just apply to the U.S. Recruitment firm Hays says it's seeing crypto companies target talent from the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Apple in the U.K. and Ireland, too. \"As more crypto\/Web3 companies emerge, we expect the market for tech talent across all levels to become even more competitive,\" James Hallahan, director of U.K. and Ireland for Hays' technology division, told CNBC. Web3 has its skeptics Web3 is still a loosely defined term. It broadly refers to initiatives aimed at building a decentralized version of the internet based around crypto networks. watch now VIDEO12:5012:50 How Wall Street learned to love bitcoin Crypto In theory, platforms could reward users for their posts through blockchain-native tokens, flipping the advertising-fueled model of services like Facebook and YouTube on its head. But Web3 has drawn criticism from some big names in Silicon Valley. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey argues it's too centralized and controlled by a handful of venture capitalists, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk views it as more of a \"marketing buzzword\" than reality. However, Wyatt said that when he started at YouTube, people were skeptical about the idea of watching others playing video games \u2014 even \"endemic gamers.\" Now, gaming is the second-biggest vertical on YouTube, according to Wyatt. Similarly, he thinks that some of the backlash against crypto and Web3 will subside as more fleshed-out experiences, like blockbuster video games and social apps, start to get rolled out. But don't expect tech giants to take the challenge lying down. Meta started developing its Novi crypto wallet in 2019, and is reportedly considering rolling out new tools for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs."

The $200 million investment was led by Lightspeed and Silver Lake, and Alchemy's previous financing round in late October valued the company at $3.5 billion.

Proponents describe it as a better, decentralized version of the internet. But Web3 has also attracted high-profile skeptics like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey. Most consumers wouldn't interact directly with Alchemy. Its platform is used behind the scenes by developers to build applications on top of blockchains, such as Ethereum. It was used to build NBA Top Shot, video game Axie Infinity and OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace. Adobe announced it would begin offering NFTs through a Photoshop feature and is working with Alchemy. Some of its investors have compared the start-up to Amazon Web Services, which sits between the internet and companies like Netflix and Uber that use it to host their websites. Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban said it plays a \"foundational role in creating an entire industry.\" Still, competition for blockchain infrastructure has been heating up. Google's cloud division recently formed a group to build business around blockchain applications. Cryptocurrency giant Coinbase is working on \"Coinbase Cloud,\" which CEO Brian Armstrong described the unit on a recent earnings call as the \"AWS of crypto.\" Another blockchain infrastructure start-up, Blockdaemon, announced a funding round in January that valued it at $3.5 billion. \"There's a bunch of people who have been trying to do this over the years, and it's a really difficult technology problem to solve,\" Alchemy co-founder and CEO Nikil Viswanathan told CNBC. \"We welcome more people coming into the space because it helps expand the whole market.\" Despite the excitement from venture capital investors, cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies have been punished in public markets lately. Bitcoin dropped 20% in January and still held up better than most major cryptocurrencies. Shares of Coinbase and Block, formerly Square, are down double digits for the year. In what looked to be a bear market, Viswanathan said the past few months marked the \"fastest growth\" in company history, with Alchemy tripling the amount of customers building on its platform. He also noted an \"exodus\" from Big Tech as more talent looks to bet their careers on the quickly growing space."

        "detailedArticleContent": "The logo of cryptocurrency network Polygon. Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto via Getty Images Sequoia Capital is playing catchup with arch-rival Andreessen Horowitz in the race to invest in what could be the future of the internet \u2014 so-called Web3. The Silicon Valley venture capital firm led a $450 million investment in Polygon, a blockchain network. Blockchains are the distributed logs of transactions that underpin many of the world's major digital currencies. They are maintained by a network of computers, which have to reach consensus across the whole system to confirm transactions and mint new units of currency. Polygon serves as a support layer to Ethereum, the platform behind the ether cryptocurrency, helping it process transactions at scale. The Ethereum network is different from bitcoin's in that it supports applications for things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) services, not just peer-to-peer transfers. How Polygon works Over the years, the Ethereum blockchain has become congested as more and more users have piled in, resulting in slower transaction times and higher processing fees. This has led to the creation of so-called \"Layer 2\" network like Polygon, which aim to take a load off the main blockchain. Polygon sits on top of the Ethereum network as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whereas Ethereum uses power-intensive crypto mining to verify transactions, participants in Polygon's network just need to show they hold some tokens \u2014 in other words, a \"stake\" \u2014 to become validators. The result is much faster transaction times \u2014 in the thousands per second, according to Polygon. In comparison, Ethereum's network can handle about 15 transactions per second. Polygon says it's completed over a billion transactions to date and has around 2.7 million monthly active users. Ethereum is embarking on an upgrade, called Ethereum 2.0, that would make it faster and more efficient. The upgrade still has a way to go before becoming reality, but some experts fear it poses a threat to Polygon. For its part, Polygon says it expects demand for blockchain scaling services to remain strong even after Ethereum 2.0 is implemented. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal says he sees the company becoming a decentralized version of Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's cloud computing arm. Polygon's grander ambitions form part of a movement in the crypto world known as \"Web3.\" What is Web3? Web3 is a hazy concept in tech that refers to efforts to build a more decentralized version of the internet based on blockchain technology. It's generated quite a bit of chatter in Silicon Valley. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has criticized it as a \"centralized entity\" controlled by venture capitalists, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it seems like more of a \"marketing buzzword\" than reality.

Whereas companies like Facebook or Twitter control their own computations, Web3 promises \"transparency\" around those processes, Nailwal said. Polygon wants to be the platform for big brands to develop their own Web3 strategies. It's already got companies like Adidas and Prada experimenting with NFTs on its network. Nailwal says not all corporations are sold on crypto yet, but NFTs have been easier for them to digest. Big-name investors Hype around Web3 has attracted some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global and Sequoia. So far, Sequoia has stayed relatively quiet about its interest in crypto, while Andreessen has its own dedicated fund for investing in the sector. Now, Sequoia is becoming more vocal. \"Thousands of developers across a range of applications are choosing Polygon and their complete set of scaling solutions for the Ethereum ecosystem,\" said Shailesh Lakhani, managing director of Sequoia India. \"This is an ambitious and aggressive team, one that values innovation at its core.\" Like Ethereum and other blockchains, Polygon has its own token, called matic. Rather than issuing new shares, the company sold units of token to investors in a private round.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The logo of cryptocurrency network Polygon. Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto via Getty Images Sequoia Capital is playing catchup with arch-rival Andreessen Horowitz in the race to invest in what could be the future of the internet \u2014 so-called Web3. The Silicon Valley venture capital firm led a $450 million investment in Polygon, a blockchain network. Blockchains are the distributed logs of transactions that underpin many of the world's major digital currencies. They are maintained by a network of computers, which have to reach consensus across the whole system to confirm transactions and mint new units of currency. Polygon serves as a support layer to Ethereum, the platform behind the ether cryptocurrency, helping it process transactions at scale. The Ethereum network is different from bitcoin's in that it supports applications for things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) services, not just peer-to-peer transfers. How Polygon works Over the years, the Ethereum blockchain has become congested as more and more users have piled in, resulting in slower transaction times and higher processing fees. This has led to the creation of so-called \"Layer 2\" network like Polygon, which aim to take a load off the main blockchain. Polygon sits on top of the Ethereum network as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whereas Ethereum uses power-intensive crypto mining to verify transactions, participants in Polygon's network just need to show they hold some tokens \u2014 in other words, a \"stake\" \u2014 to become validators. The result is much faster transaction times \u2014 in the thousands per second, according to Polygon. In comparison, Ethereum's network can handle about 15 transactions per second. Polygon says it's completed over a billion transactions to date and has around 2.7 million monthly active users. Ethereum is embarking on an upgrade, called Ethereum 2.0, that would make it faster and more efficient. The upgrade still has a way to go before becoming reality, but some experts fear it poses a threat to Polygon. For its part, Polygon says it expects demand for blockchain scaling services to remain strong even after Ethereum 2.0 is implemented. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal says he sees the company becoming a decentralized version of Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce giant's cloud computing arm. Polygon's grander ambitions form part of a movement in the crypto world known as \"Web3.\" What is Web3? Web3 is a hazy concept in tech that refers to efforts to build a more decentralized version of the internet based on blockchain technology. It's generated quite a bit of chatter in Silicon Valley. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has criticized it as a \"centralized entity\" controlled by venture capitalists, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it seems like more of a \"marketing buzzword\" than reality. Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC Pro This self-driving car technology stock could pop by more than 400%, say three analysts Looking for alternatives to Nvidia? Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside \"Web3 for me means ownership, censorship resistance and verified compute,\" Nailwal told CNBC. Whereas companies like Facebook or Twitter control their own computations, Web3 promises \"transparency\" around those processes, Nailwal said. Polygon wants to be the platform for big brands to develop their own Web3 strategies. It's already got companies like Adidas and Prada experimenting with NFTs on its network. Nailwal says not all corporations are sold on crypto yet, but NFTs have been easier for them to digest. Big-name investors Hype around Web3 has attracted some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global and Sequoia. So far, Sequoia has stayed relatively quiet about its interest in crypto, while Andreessen has its own dedicated fund for investing in the sector. Now, Sequoia is becoming more vocal. \"Thousands of developers across a range of applications are choosing Polygon and their complete set of scaling solutions for the Ethereum ecosystem,\" said Shailesh Lakhani, managing director of Sequoia India. \"This is an ambitious and aggressive team, one that values innovation at its core.\" Like Ethereum and other blockchains, Polygon has its own token, called matic. Rather than issuing new shares, the company sold units of token to investors in a private round. Polygon's backers are making a bet that matic will go up in value as adoption of its network increases. The funds came from Sequoia's India unit, with SoftBank, Galaxy Digital and Tiger Global also investing. It echoes a similar deal involving Solana Labs, the start-up behind Ethereum-rival Solana, which raised $314 million in a private token sale backed by Andreessen Horowitz.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Olympic Games Jam: Beijing 2022 is a Winter Games-themed game that incorporates non-fungible tokens (NFTs). nWay The International Olympic Committee has become the latest organization to jump into the non-fungible token craze. The association that organizes the Olympic Games said Thursday it has launched a mobile game based on the upcoming Beijing 2022 winter event. The game will incorporate NFTs, collectible crypto tokens designed to represent ownership of virtual properties. The app, called Olympic Games Jam: Beijing 2022, was developed by nWay, a blockchain game studio owned by Hong Kong-headquartered firm Animoca Brands. NWay's titles reward users with NFTs as they progress, part of a fast-growing genre of games known as \"play to earn.\" Olympic Games Jam: Beijing 2022 will let players compete in a number of sporting events, including snowboarding and skiing. Users can also don their avatars with a range of custom skins. People will be able to buy digital versions of the famous Olympic pins and trade them with other users on nWay's marketplace. The digital pins are licensed through the IOC's official licensing program, with the organization taking royalties on each sale. Taehoon Kim, CEO of nWay, said the company's new game would allow people to \"own a piece of Olympic history.\" \"We intend to support the game with continuous updates in the months to come, to keep the players engaged, and the Olympic spirit ongoing,\" he said in a statement Thursday. An nWay spokesperson said the game will be available in each country where Apple's App Store and Google Play are available. This excludes China, which has strict regulations both on games \u2014 all of which must be approved by Beijing officials \u2014 and crypto. The Chinese government moved to stamp out all crypto-related activities last year. The launch arrives a day before the opening ceremony for the Beijing Winter Games. The IOC first unveiled plans to enter the NFT space last year, introducing virtual pins that can be collected or traded. It hopes to expand the audience for these pins with its new game. The move could prove controversial, however. Several brands have tried to break into the NFT market, often facing criticisms due to concerns over fraudulent activity in the market and the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. NFTs have proven particularly unpopular with gamers, who have protested various moves in the space from publishers like Ubisoft and Team17, the maker of Worms.Gamers have criticized NFTs as a cash grab, with echoes of the controversy surrounding \"pay to win\" mechanics where players can gain an advantage over others by shelling out real cash for better items or abilities. Proponents of NFTs, on the other hand, say they provide people with the ability to own in-game items in a way that they can't on centralized services from big publishers. NFTs can be thought of as a digital receipt on the blockchain which says you own a particular item. Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through 2032."

        "detailedArticleContent": "Chesnot | Getty Images China has designated some cities and entities to trial blockchain applications, underscoring the importance Beijing is attaching to this particular technology. In 2019, President Xi Jinping called on China to \"seize the opportunities\" presented by blockchain, giving his personal backing to the technology. The Chinese capital Beijing and mega city Shanghai as well as Guangzhou in the south are all part of the pilot projects. Local government departments, universities, banks, hospitals, car companies and power firms are among the 164 entities chosen by China to carry out trial blockchain applications. Blockchain originally referred to the technology that underpinned the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It is a public, tamper-proof and immutable ledger of activity. It is also \"decentralized\" meaning it is not run or owned by a single entity. But the definition of blockchain has widened as many different industries look to use the technology for a variety of applications. Other names like \"distributed ledger technology\" or DLT are now often used and bear differences to the original bitcoin blockchain. Still, the idea of a single authentic record of activity is attractive. China's cyberspace regulator along with other regulators issued a notice on Sunday in which it called on provincial-level regulators to \"give full play to the role of blockchain\" in areas such as data sharing, optimizing business processes and reduce operating costs. All the pilot units should \"give priority to adopting blockchain software and hardware technologies,\" the notice said. China's blockchain push comes after it renewed a crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and mining last year. Beijing has long-viewed bitcoin and other digital coins as a threat to financial stability. Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China is pushing ahead with the rollout of a digital version of the country's yuan. However, it is not a decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin. It will be controlled and issued by the Chinese central bank."

        "detailedArticleContent": "Mark Zuckerberg is going to start letting a handful of Horizon Worlds creators sell virtual items as he continues with his push to the metaverse. Facebook | via Reuters If 2021's word of the year was \"NFT,\" Avery Akkineni says 2022's will be \"Web 3.0.\" As president of VaynerNFT, Akkineni spends much of her time consulting with brands looking to get a piece of the metaverse action. The notion of a \"corporate metaverse strategy\" is new \u2014 VaynerNFT itself was founded less than 6 months ago \u2014 but it's building momentum. The company's first client was Budweiser, and Akkineni foresees plenty of other major brands following its lead. In fact, the baseline, widely agreed-upon prediction for 2022: more major brands will get involved in Web3 projects. \"2022 will be the year major brands embrace NFTs in a big way,\" says Lin Dai, CEO of music NFT platform OneOf. The Quincy Jones-backed start-up is behind the near $1 million auction for an NFT of a never-before-heard Whitney Houston song, and has collaborated with The Recording Academy for an exclusive Grammy Awards partnership. But this year, digital assets built on the blockchain will likely continue to expand well beyond the music and art industries. Luxury fashion brand Balenciaga has already teamed up with Fortnite to deliver to users designer \"skins\" to wear inside the game. Gucci has done the same with Roblox, and Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren have launched their own Roblox experiences. Brian Trunzo, metaverse Lead at Polygon Studios, which focuses on gaming, NFTs and Web3 efforts linked to the polygon digital currency and ethereum blockchain network, says nimble, smart streetwear brands are already in the space as well. \"The players have finally taken the field, and the game is about to truly start,\" Trunzo said. Akkineni says that the focus for brands, at least at this point, isn't to win but simply to get involved. So far, brand engagement with blockchain projects has been about building community and staying relevant. The Nike and Adidas NFT drops, for example, generated more buzz than cash, but they lent legitimacy to a still-nascent space. More direct commercialization strategies could be coming. Cathy Hackl, CEO and chief metaverse officer for the Futures Intelligence Group, a metaverse consultant, points out that for luxury brands in particular, the metaverse could be an access point for a secondary market. \"When someone sells their Birkin bag on The RealReal, Hermes does not see a cut of that. But through blockchain and NFTs, they are eventually going to get a cut of the secondary market,\" Hackl said. There will be more jobs in the metaverse As more companies seek a foothold in the digital universe, hiring opportunities for candidates comfortable with Web3 will grow. Hackl says her title may become more common. \"Even if you look at job boards, you're increasingly seeing demand for Solidity developers and Discord managers,\" Akkineni said. Solidity is a computer language used in conjunction with the ethereum blockchain to build and deploy smart contracts. Discord is a social media platform favored by many gamers and the crypto community. Big brands will naturally help drive Web3 job creation, but a new kind of employment might take center stage. The play-to-earn gaming model gained popularity in the Philippines with Axie Infinity four years ago, and now the game has over 1.8 million daily active users, some reporting an income of about $10 a day, and up to $1,000-$2,000 a month from solely playing the game. \"It's kind of like a universal basic income experiment mixed with an e-sport,\" says Vance Spencer, a DeFi venture capitalist and co-founder of Framework Ventures. Gaming and metaverse crossover investments grow There has been controversy within the gaming world about virtual monetization, but the math that supports more investments linking the metaverse to gaming is simple, according to Spencer. Gaming is the biggest segment of the entertainment industry, with nearly 3 billion regular participants. Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity's developer, was the first to monetize NFTs in a gaming environment, but it won't be the last. Investors are recognizing the potential in crypto-gaming crossover. In October, Sky Mavis raised $152 million from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Cuban. Developers looking to do the same are likely to be successful, although for Spencer, the most upside is for developers making AAA-quality games that can be played on PC, like Take-Two Interactive's Grand Theft Auto and EA's FIFA. Roblox, though, and even Minecraft, have found substantial success despite not being AAA games. GameStop is making the same bet, announcing plans to launch its own NFT marketplace. It's likely that GME will need to make a slew of Web3 hires to execute the plan. Brands are likely to tap into the gaming revenue streams, too. \"There's a direct commercialization opportunity in the gaming space. \u2026 People are very used to paying $20, $50, $100 per skin,\" Akkineni said. And gamers are indeed willing to shell out for their virtual avatars: the digital version of Gucci's Dionysus bag sold on Roblox for more than the bag's IRL retail price. Metaverse will be one of the world's biggest infrastructure projects The bigger the corporate plans for the digital world, the more computing power we'll need. As more brands leverage NFTs to build their communities in virtual worlds and as more consumers follow them in, technological and physical infrastructure moves into the foreground of the metaverse landscape. At the end of 2021, Intel estimated that Web3 metaverse projects will eventually demand at least 1000x the computing power we have now. watch now VIDEO9:0609:06 Top analyst on Web3 and venture capital's role in the space Fast Money Another prediction for 2022: advancements in infrastructure. \"The amount of concurrent users online within a single server or 'node' in all virtual worlds will continue to increase,\" Trunzo said, and with that, advancements in the physical components to make the kind of consistent traffic possible and reliable. It's a natural and necessary part of tech's maturation, and it keeps the semiconductor mainstays like Intel and Nvidia in a solid position, whatever becomes of the metaverse. A boom for now, but winter is coming The world of NFTs and blockchain-based digital assets is, for now, a hot one. But winter could be coming. Akinneni said, as demand will likely cool off and by the end of 2022, we may find fewer projects and fewer drops. \"This probably won't be the year where we have a 90% drawdown in teams that are working on projects, but this will be the start of the end of the beginning,\" Spencer said. Not every blockchain project has the team to push it into the mainstream, and Spencer expects a maturation shift, and healthy consolidation. This consolidation could emerge in legacy brand M&A strategies. Akkineni points to Nike's acquisition of RTFKT as a pivotal moment in blockchain legitimacy beyond the crypto-native crowd. For big Fortune 50 or Fortune 500 brands, it's not too early to consider making similar deals, Hackl said. The biggest hurdles for the digital worlds of 2022 are scalability, in the form of computing power and interoperability between discrete metaverses, and security. Both of which, Akkineni points out, are typical for emerging technologies. watch now VIDEO7:1207:12 What's next for the metaverse Fast Money"

        "detailedArticleContent": "watch now VIDEO0:3000:30 Kevin O'Leary on why he thinks NFTs will become bigger than bitcoin Capital Connection \"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary is a big believer in non-fungible tokens \u2014 he even thinks they have a shot at becoming bigger than bitcoin. O'Leary, the chairman of O'Shares Investment Advisers, said his belief in NFTs stems from the idea that can they prove ownership of real-world items, such as designer watches or flash cars, digitally rather than with paper records. NFTs are one-of-a-kind crypto tokens that serve to track the provenance and authenticity of rare virtual collectible items such as art and sports memorabilia. There have also been efforts to bring NFTs to physical assets. \"You're going to see a lot of movement in terms of doing authentication and insurance policies and real estate transfer taxes all online over the next few years, making NFTs a much bigger, more fluid market potentially than just bitcoin alone,\" O'Leary told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" Wednesday. \"We'll see what happens but I'm making that bet and I'm investing on both sides of that equation.\" Barely anyone had heard of NFTs in 2020, but they became a huge phenomenon the following year. More than $20 billion worth of the tokens changed hands throughout 2021, according to some estimates. The trend gained particular public attention after a collage by the digital artist Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, was sold for a record $69 million. watch now VIDEO3:1003:10 U.S. Fed unlikely to hike interest rates thrice this year, says Kevin O'Leary Capital Connection However, there are concerns about the sustainability of the market. Some have compared it to the initial coin offering frenzy of 2017, which saw several investors get defrauded by betting on start-ups through unregulated token sales. Meanwhile, there have been a number of scams and instances of stolen art, raising red flags for some traders. Change of heart The millionaire Canadian investor has changed his tune on crypto over the years, having previously called bitcoin \"garbage.\" \"It is a useless currency,\" O'Leary told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in May 2019. \"It's worthless.\" More recently, O'Leary has warmed to the space, viewing it as a way of diversifying from other assets such as real estate amid rising inflation. He is particularly bullish on \"decentralized finance,\" a trend that aims to replicate traditional financial products using blockchain. O'Leary recently disclosed that his largest position is in ether, while he also owns some polygon, solana and bitcoin. Around 40% of new checks O'Leary has written in the last six months were for crypto and blockchain-related ventures. Regulation O'Leary stressed the importance of ensuring crypto becomes regulated. Regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere are racing to catch up with developments in the market to prevent potential money laundering and protect consumers from financial harm. \"Different geographies have different policy regarding crypto,\" O'Leary said. \"You have to go and find jurisdictions that are more progressive.\" He cited Canada, his home country, as an example of a jurisdiction that is more progressive than others on the issue of crypto. Canada was the first to approve an exchange-traded fund that gives investors exposure to bitcoin. Though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has since greenlit a bitcoin-linked ETF, the product tracks futures contracts instead of investing in bitcoin directly. O'Leary also cited the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland as other countries that are opening up to crypto. \"You have to be optimistic and constructive,\" O'Leary said. \"The floodgate of capital will come in through sovereign and pension plans that doesn't exist yet.\" Of particular concern to regulators are stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to the value of sovereign currencies like the dollar. Economists worry notable stablecoins like tether and USD Coin may not have the appropriate reserves available to justify their claims of being backed by dollars. \"I think [stablecoins] will also get a chance to shine in the sun as a great way to get yield when you can't get any yield on cash,\" O'Leary said."

Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images Cryptocurrencies have had yet another wild year. Bitcoin, the world's largest digital asset, has seen a roughly 65% gain since January \u2014 with some ten to twenty percent swings in between. It brought in a crop of new, individual investors along the way as payment giants like PayPal started letting users trade crypto. More billionaires and institutional investors dove in to help legitimize the asset class. The industry now sprawls well beyond bitcoin. NFTs, blockchain-based videogames and \"Web3\" are top of executives' minds heading into next year. Regulation remains as the biggest uncertainty. Here's a look at what some of the industry's most influential executives had to say. FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried The 29-year-old founder and CEO told CNBC he doesn't expect legislative action to be the immediate answer for \"regulatory clarity.\" Especially since it's \"pretty hard right now to get things through Congress.\" It's just as likely to be cobbled together from a series of statements, enforcement actions, and \"other indications\" to set the guardrails,\" Bankman-Fried said. The CEO is still bullish on Solana as an alternative to Ethereum. But it's possible that a new blockchain pops up as the \"Holy Grail\" that would eventually be able to host a million transactions per second. Right now, he said there are \"very few even trying to get that point.\" \"There will be substantial fleshing out of the crypto regulatory systems over the next few years.\" \"Most banks have effectively decided internally that they will be entering the crypto ecosystem. But how and when they do it is going to depend a lot on the details of regulatory structure.\" \"There's enormous worry about stablecoins right now. But it's pretty straightforward to address. You have attestations, or you have an audit from a regulator.\" \"The thing that people are worried about with stablecoins is are they stable? If you can address that, you've addressed most of the worries about it from a customer protection and a systemic risk perspective. It's not that hard to do. So I'm cautiously optimistic that that's where we're going.\" Circle CEO, Jeremy Allaire Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder and CEO, Circle David A. Grogan | CNBC The CEO of Circle is calling for more use of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, or stablecoins, by e-commerce firms, consumers and financial institutions. Circle, which is set to go public via SPAC, operates its own stablecoin called USDC. Allaire expects to see more institutional adoption and celebrity trendsetters lending their brands to crypto through NFTs. DAOs, which rely on crowdfunding, may even \"challenge venture capital investors on some of the largest and hottest deals in crypto,\" he said. The biggest threat? \"Incoherent and inconsistent, hastily formed regulations and policy,\" Allaire said. \"Even in an environment where the Fed raises interest rates, investors and businesses will be hungry for the high-yield opportunities offered through digital assets. So expect to see institutional adoption of digital assets balloon \u2014 directly, through ETFs, or custom yield-generating products.\" \"There is bipartisan recognition that blockchain and crypto technologies represent a U.S. competitive advantage, especially if properly regulated, so new legislation and laws will come quicker than many people expect.\" \"In 2022 stablecoin adoption will continue its upward trajectory. We believe that dollars on the internet will soon be as efficient and widely available as text messages and email.\" Bitfury CEO & former head of the OCC, Brian Brooks Brian Brooks, chief executive officer of Bitfury Group Ltd., speaks during a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Dec. 8, 2021. Stefani Reynolds | Bloomberg | Getty Images Brian Brooks, the former Acting Comptroller of the Currency, said there's now consensus among lawmakers in Washington that crypto is here to stay. He expects more blockbuster funding rounds after a record 2021, continued mainstream understanding of the crypto space. For example, not all \"crypto\" are currencies, or meant to act like currencies, he said. \"Retail adoption is there and will continue to accelerate, but for those established Wall Street firms and other financial services companies that are not already involved in the crypto ecosystem, it is a matter of \"when\" not \"if\". \"The need for clear regulatory action that creates a sustainable framework to allow crypto and Web 3 to grow in the United States will reach its tipping point.\" \"The level of activity and innovation occurring in the space is too great to ignore, as is the risk to American competitiveness in technology and capital markets.\" Paxos CEO, Charles Cascarilla Chad Cascarilla, CEO of Paxos. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Paxos is the company powering PayPal's crypto offering behind the scenes. CEO Charles Cascarilla also expects more action in the stablecoin market. His company offers its own dollar-pegged coin, USDP. The CEO is one of many warning that the U.S. has a lot to lose if it gets regulation wrong. \"Big tech and finance players like Venmo, Interactive Brokers and Mercado Libre entered crypto in 2021. There will be even more and bigger players joining the onslaught next year.\" \"2022 is the year of the stablecoin. Consumer wallets enabled stablecoins for the first time this year. Money is a product and it needs to be updated for how people live today. Regulated stablecoins like USDP are the answer.\" \"Regulatory clarity, consistency and certainty will foster Safe blockchain innovation in the US. This technology presents many opportunities for American market primacy in the long-term if we get this right, and there are many risks if we get it wrong.\" Grayscale Investments CEO, Michael Sonnenshein This year marked an industry milestone of the first futures-based bitcoin ETF. But Grayscale and others in the industry are looking to take that a step further. It's looking to convert the world's largest bitcoin trust, GBTC, into an ETF and CEO Michael Sonnenshein is optimistic for an approval in 2022. He's also seeing investor interest beyond bitcoin, and \"tension\" between Big Tech and start-ups. \"We're entering into 2022 without a [spot] Bitcoin ETF, but believe that in the coming year the SEC and other regulators will continue to dig in on this issue. We remain optimistic that they will allow for an even playing field -- and give investors the optionality between both spot and futures-based ETF products for getting exposure.\" \"This was certainly a year when we thought people were diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ether. We're starting to see that investors are going to specific protocols and projects, and an increasing mindshare among investors that the universe of crypto assets is only broadening.\" \"There will be an expanded conversation around the tension between some of these centralized platforms that are today managed by social media and e-commerce giants, and established tech companies versus some of these up and coming decentralized platforms.\" Robinhood Crypto Lead and COO, Christine Brown Robinhood started as a stock-trading start-up. But in its second quarter as a public company, it got more than half of total revenue from crypto trades. Of that, more than 60% came from Dogecoin transactions. As the asset class becomes more important to the company's bottom line, executives have said they're moving slowly on adding new assets to the platform, until there's more regulatory clarity. \"2021 was the year crypto went mainstream.\" \"Whether through NFTs or their token of choice, more people engaged in crypto in what was a breakout year.\" \"Crypto has long had a HODL mentality, and that extended to NFTs in 2021 where JPGs replaced photos all across social media. The infrastructure investment from 2017 is ready for primetime, with multiple layer L1s and L2 platforms flourishing in 2021. With more crypto enthusiasts to cater to, 2022 will see companies focus more on design and user experience to ease that transition from web 2 to web 3, and we'll continue to see major brands continuing to get involved.\" Anthony Pompliano, head of Pomp Investments If you've ever perused crypto Twitter, you probably know \"Pomp.\" With more than 1 million followers, the investor is known for his bullish calls on bitcoin and said the asset has transitioned from a contrarian idea, to a \"consensus idea on Wall Street in 2021.\" He expects more adoption next year from legacy companies buying bitcoin for their balance sheets, and eventually building dedicated business units. Pompliano also highlighted moves in the bitcoin mining industry after China made the activity illegal, bitcoin's potential for global payments, and a \"brain drain\" underway from Big Tech and Wall Street. \"Bitcoin mining transitioned from a largely international activity to a US-centric activity in 2021. It would not surprise me to see new all-time highs in the bitcoin hash rate in 2022, along with continued market share growth for the US as a whole, along with Texas as a single state.\" \"We saw a major social media platform, Twitter, embrace the Lightning Network for payments in 2021 via Strike's API (I'm an investor). We also saw a nation state, El Salvador, embrace the Lightning Network for payments. We should expect multiple large Fortune 500 companies to embrace the Lightning Network in 2022 for payments.\" \"The brain drain from legacy technology and finance industry will continue. Young people, and increasingly the most skilled people, want to focus their talents on the industry where they can have the greatest impact. Crypto has been growing at an incredible rate, both in terms of new jobs, new companies, funding, economic value created, etc. This transition has only begun and will likely accelerate in 2022.\" Michelle Bond, CEO of Association for Digital Asset Markets While this was a busy year for the crypto trade association in DC, \"2022 is going to be way busier,\" Bond said. She also expects the SEC to come out with more enforcement actions. \"The Biden administration has been in office for a year. We're now presented with a window where something can get done on a bipartisan basis. And that will advance the industry and it will provide guardrails for market integrity and consumer protection.\" \"While final legislation may not actually take place, take effect in 2022. I think the direction of travel is going to be clear, and what we're doing in 2022 is setting the stage for 2023, 2024 and beyond.\" \"The balance is going to be one finding a policy framework in which the industry can flourish and the U.S. can benefit where consumers can also be protected.\" Gemini COO, Noah Perlman The crypto exchange, founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, climbed to a $7 billion valuation this year and is among the dozens with a bitcoin ETF application in the works. Its COO, Noah Perlman, sees crypto payments going mainstream, more non-tech companies embracing the Metaverse, and more women jumping into a male-dominated market. \"More retail companies with household names will expand their crypto offerings, further legitimizing digital currencies as a form of payment and as an asset. Credit card companies such as Mastercard and Visa that offer crypto rewards will become more prevalent, which will make investing in digital assets as easy as swiping your card at a store.\" \"It's no surprise to see tech giants Apple, Meta, Snap, Alphabet, and Microsoft build out their Metatverse ecosystem, but we expect this trend will target other industries as we've seen with Nike's acquisition of RTFKT and Adidas launching an NFT collection called \"Into the Metaverse\". \"The profile of the typical crypto investor will change significantly in 2022. Previously, the typical crypto investor was a man in his 30s making more than $100,000 per year. We already saw some significant demographic shifts in the past year. According to Gemini's 2021 State of the US Crypto Report, 63 percent of U.S. adults are crypto-curious, meaning they don't yet own crypto but report interest in learning more or holding digital assets soon.\" \"We'll see an approval for a spot bitcoin ETF most likely in H1.\" John Wu, President of Ava Labs Ethereum has had a break-out year but new, alternative blockchains are popping up as platforms to build NFTs and other apps. Avalanche is among the new challengers to Ethereum. The president of Ava Labs, a former hedge fund trader, predicts a shake out of \"speculative\" assets, and a \"brain drain\" as software developers leave Big Tech in search of next wave of computing. He also expects bitcoin's market dominance to keep declining. \"We will continue to see inflows into smart contract platforms, DeFi, Gaming and metaverse. The winners will be the ones with strong growth of users, use cases and transaction activity. Speculative assets with no network effects will be the losers.\" \"BTC still has strong interest from both institutional and retail investors. Let's not forget that it has had a 10 year lead time compared to other platforms so it still has the biggest brand name out there. On the other hand, it's dominance over the crypto market is declining and will continue to do so.\" \"While these smart contracts platforms do compete with each other for developers, the real competition is with traditional web 2.0 companies like Google and Facebook. We are seeing tremendous interest from web 2.0 developers who want to now build on decentralized systems because they find web 3.0 to be a lot more creative and exciting.\""

The digital currency is up nearly 70% since the start of 2021, driving the entire crypto market to a combined $2 trillion in value. It's a year that's seen the first major crypto company go public with the debut of Coinbase in April, increased participation from Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs, and the approval of the first U.S. exchange-traded fund linked to bitcoin. However, heightened regulatory scrutiny and intense price fluctuations have dampened bitcoin's prospects lately. And experts warn the market could be heading toward a downturn. With next year already looking like another roller-coaster period for digital currencies, CNBC takes a look at analysts' biggest predictions. Crypto crash Some experts believe bitcoin is due for a sharp decline in the coming months. The cryptocurrency surged to a record high of almost $69,000 in November. It's now sitting below $50,000, down almost 30% from its peak. Wall Street wisdom defines bear markets as a decline of 20% or more from recent highs, but it's worth noting bitcoin is notorious for its volatility. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, said she expects bitcoin to tank to as low as $10,000 in 2022, virtually wiping out all of its gains in the past year and a half. \"If I were an investor now I would think about coming out of bitcoin soon because its price will probably crash next year,\" Alexander said. Her bearish call hinges on the notion that bitcoin \"has no fundamental value\" and serves as more of a \"toy\" than an investment. watch now VIDEO8:1008:10 What you should know before investing in crypto International Digital Originals Alexander warned of history repeating itself. In 2018, bitcoin tumbled close to $3,000 after climbing to a high of nearly $20,000 a few months earlier. The cryptocurrency's backers often say that things are different this time, as more institutional investors are jumping into the market. \"Without question, Bitcoin's price chart appears to track many historical asset bubbles and busts and is carrying a 'this time it's different' narrative just like other bubbles,\" said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist of Union Bank's private banking arm. A common investment case for bitcoin is that it serves as a hedge against rising inflation caused by government stimulus. Lowenstein said there's a risk that a more hawkish Federal Reserve may take the wind out of bitcoin's sails.

Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside \"Goldilocks conditions are ending and the liquidity tide is receding which will disproportionately harm overvalued asset classes and speculative areas of the market including cryptocurrencies,\" he said. Still, not everyone is convinced the crypto party will end in 2022. \"The biggest risk factor, namely [quantitative tapering] by the Fed, has been decided and likely priced in already,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese digital asset exchange Bitbank. First spot bitcoin ETF A big development crypto investors are on the lookout for in 2022 is approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the United States. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted the launch of ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy ETF this year, the product tracks bitcoin futures contracts rather than giving investors direct exposure to the cryptocurrency itself. Futures are financial derivatives that oblige an investor to buy or sell an asset at a later date and for an agreed-upon price. By tracking futures prices instead of bitcoin itself, experts say, ProShares' ETF could be too risky for novice traders, many of whom are invested in crypto. \"The Bitcoin Futures ETF that launched this year has been widely regarded as not very retail-friendly given the high costs involved of rolling over contracts which amounts to around 5-10%,\" said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and global expansion at crypto exchange Luno. \"Increasing pressure\/evidence\u2026 points to a Bitcoin Spot ETF being approved in 2022 mainly because the market is now large and mature enough to support one.\" Grayscale Investments has filed to convert its bitcoin trust, which is the world's biggest bitcoin fund, into a spot ETF. And there are plenty of other bitcoin ETF applications waiting in the wings. Rotation into 'DeFi' As the crypto industry has evolved, bitcoin's share of the market has waned, with other digital currencies like ethereum playing a much larger role. This is something analysts expect to continue into next year, as investors increasingly look to smaller pockets of crypto in the hope of big gains. Sussex University's Alexander flagged ethereum, solana, polkadot and cardano as coins to watch in 2022. \"As retail investors begin to realize the dangers of trading bitcoin, especially on unregulated venues, they will switch to \u2026 other coins belonging to blockchains which actually serve an essential and fundamental role in decentralized finance,\" she said. \"This time next year I predict that bitcoin's market cap will be half the combined cap of smart contract coins\" like ethereum and solana, Alexander added, \"or even less.\" Emerging crypto developments such as decentralized finance and decentralized autonomous organizations are \"likely to be the highest growth areas of crypto,\" said Bryan Gross, network steward at crypto platform ICHI. DeFi aims to recreate traditional financial products without middlemen, while DAOs can be thought of as a new type of internet community. Total money deposited into DeFi services surpassed $200 billion for the first time this year, and experts project demand to grow further in 2022. DeFi is part of a broader trend in tech known as Web3. The Web3 movement calls for a new, decentralized iteration of the internet encompassing blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies such as nonfungible tokens. It has already found skeptics in the likes of Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey, however. 'A big year on the regulatory front' Regulators flexed their muscles on cryptocurrencies this year, with China completely banning all crypto-related activities and U.S. authorities cracking down on certain aspects of the market. Analysts widely expect regulation to be a key issue in 2022 for the sector. \"2022 will be a big year on the regulatory front, no doubt,\" Luno's Ayyar said. \"The interest from various governments, and especially the U.S., to bring regulation into the crypto space has not been higher.\" Ayyar said he expects to see some clarification on the legal \"gray zone\" of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and ethereum, which the SEC has said are not securities. Blockchain company Ripple is locking horns with the U.S. watchdog over XRP, a cryptocurrency it is closely associated with. The SEC alleges XRP is an unregistered security and that $1.3 billion worth of the tokens were illegally sold by Ripple and two of its executives. For its part, Ripple says XRP should not be considered a security. watch now VIDEO3:5603:56 What are NFTs? CNBC Explains Experts say another key area regulators will likely focus on next year is stablecoins. These are tokens whose value is tied to the price of existing assets like the U.S. dollar. Tether, the world's biggest stablecoin, is particularly controversial as there are concerns about whether it holds enough assets in its reserves to justify its peg to the dollar. \"Undoubtedly more scrutiny is forthcoming around stable coins as regulators look under the hood on the soundness of the underlying collateral and amount of leverage deployed,\" said Lowenstein. \"People remember all too well when the collateral behind the housing and mortgage crises became suspect and risk appetites repriced aggressively.\" Meanwhile, regulators have also begun scrutinizing the DeFi space. Earlier this month, central bank umbrella group the Bank for International Settlements called for the regulation of DeFi, saying it's worried about services marketing themselves as \"decentralized\" when that may not be the case."

        "detailedArticleContent": "In this article EA UBI-FR Follow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNT A gamer uses a PS4 controller as he plays the new Ubisoft video game Watch Dogs Legion on October 28, 2020. Kenzo Tribouillard | AFP via Getty Images Gamers are a notoriously skeptical crowd. In 2017, for example, Electronic Arts faced huge backlash over a decision to let players pay to unlock certain characters in its \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" game. Traditionally, players are required to toil for several hours to access such content. The outcry was so intense that EA eventually walked back its plans, which critics described as a \"pay-to-win\" model. So when Ubisoft, the French video game publisher, dropped a video this month showing off its foray into non-fungible tokens, it's fair to say the reaction was a little predictable. The company debuted a platform called Quartz which lets players own in-game items such as helmets in the form of NFTs, digital assets designed to track ownership of unique items on the blockchain. The feature was added to Ubisoft's \"Ghost Recon Breakpoint\" game. The move was met with widespread anger from gamers, who slammed Quartz as a cash grab. Some commenters also raised concerns with the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. OperatorDrewski, a YouTube channel with over 1 million subscribers, commented: \"To me, this is a blatant signal that you're just milking the Ghost Recon franchise for literally every cent while putting in minimal effort into the actual game itself.\" Although YouTube has recently hidden dislikes on its videos, users downloading software to get around the change were able to find Ubisoft's trailer for Quartz has been overwhelmingly disliked, with only 1,600 likes and more than 40,000 dislikes. An Ubisoft spokesperson told CNBC the NFTs available on Quartz are currently free, and that the company is not taking a cut of any secondary market sales. \"Ubisoft Quartz is an experiment,\" the spokesperson said. \"Digits,\" Ubisoft's NFTs, are \"cosmetic, playable in-game items that have no impact on gameplay,\" the spokesperson added. \"In that sense, they are completely optional.\" Addressing environmental concerns, Ubisoft said it is relying on a less energy-intensive cryptocurrency network called Tezos. Ubisoft isn't the only gaming company jumping on the NFT bandwagon. EA CEO Andrew Wilson says the phenomenon is \"an important part of the future of our industry.\" Ukrainian developer GSC Game World wanted to integrate NFTs into its upcoming title \"STALKER 2,\" but has now scrapped those plans following pushback from fans. The industry is divided The Ubisoft debacle highlights division in the gaming world over non-fungible tokens. Last month, for instance, Microsoft Xbox chief Phil Spencer warned some efforts to bring NFTs to video games feel \"exploitive.\" \"There are definitely some aspects of [NFTs] that feel a little exploitive right now with some of these games,\" Geoff Keighley, host of The Game Awards, told CNBC on a call ahead of the video game industry's annual awards ceremony, which recently took place. While Keighley says he likes the idea of game creators making revenue through royalties on NFT sales, \"the thing I hope doesn't happen is that games become a platform just for commerce.\" \"To me, what I love about games is the worlds, stories and experiences inside them,\" he added. \"What I don't want is for things to feel transactional. It's a bit like microtransactions, when that was the big drama for gamers.\" Several cryptocurrency start-ups are betting NFTs will play a role in the world of video games. Axie Infinity, for example, is a blockchain-based game that lets users collect and breed creatures called \"Axies\" \u2014 kind of like \"Pokémon\" but with NFTs. watch now VIDEO2:0102:01 Art Basel 2021 begins as NFT, crypto enthusiasts descend upon Miami TechCheck Instead of just being \"pay-to-play,\" Axie Infinity also allows players to earn money by selling their Axie NFTs to other users. Why blockchain? Robby Yung, CEO of Animoca Brands, an investor in Axie Infinity creator Sky Mavis, said the business model in gaming has changed over the years. \"Gaming's historically more premium, meaning you bought cartridges or DVDs or, later, downloadables. You paid upfront prices for games,\" he said. \"That has transitioned largely to an economic model around free-to-play. The idea is that it's free upfront but you have virtual assets inside the game that you acquire to enhance and improve your gameplay.\" Yung says the NFT approach is innovative as it means gamers can now take ownership of digital properties they buy within a game. Players can then take those assets outside of the game and exchange it elsewhere. He said the phenomenon reminds him of his childhood. \"If you bought cartridges for your games console and you wanted the new one but couldn't afford it, you would sell some of your old games at a second-hand shop,\" Yung said. \"These days with digital content we've not had that second-hand market. And so now blockchain is enabling that to happen again, where you can dispose of content that you are no longer interested in or are not playing with anymore.\" Still, despite excitement from some over NFTs and their potential use in gaming, it's clear that not everyone is on board. While NFTs may one day have a place in video games, right now they're still in an \"embryonic stage,\" according to George Jijiashvili, principal analyst at Omdia. \"Rushing into offering NFTs without fully evaluating it could lead to serious reputational damage,\" Jijiashvili said."

        "detailedArticleContent": "Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images When Kickstarter unveiled its ambition to develop a blockchain-based crowdfunding system, the company characterized the move as a way to push creators closer to their audiences. \"Backers should be able to easily discover and participate more deeply in projects, better control their data, and have more robust tools to assess the trustworthiness and viability of a project,\" Kickstarter said in a blog post earlier this month. The reaction from users was hardly the sort of response Kickstarter had been hoping for. A tweet by the company announcing the news was met with immediate backlash from Kickstarter customers who threatened to abandon the service, citing concerns with the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and other digital currencies require huge amounts of electricity for processing transactions and minting new units of currency. For its part, Kickstarter said it would use Celo, a \"carbon-negative\" crypto payments platform, for the initiative. Kickstarter envisions the new crowdfunding mechanism as a \"decentralized\" protocol that would make it easier for people to raise funds for projects, even outside of its own platform. The eventual aim is to move its entire website over to the new infrastructure. 'Web3' Kickstarter's proposal is all part of a buzzy new movement in the technology world known as Web 3.0, or \"Web3.\" Web3 proponents argue that today's online platforms are too centralized and controlled by a handful of large internet companies, like Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook parent company Meta. Like the \"metaverse\" touted by Meta, Microsoft and others, Web3 is still a hazy concept. Most proponents describe it as a decentralized version of the internet based on blockchain, the technology behind many major cryptocurrencies. You can think of the blockchain like a ledger of transactions that's constantly being updated by multiple computers around the world. It's attracted lots of interest \u2014 and money \u2014 from venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and big tech names like Twitter and Stripe. Several conversations on Twitter about the trend are from people with NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, as their profile pictures. watch now VIDEO3:5603:56 What are NFTs? CNBC Explains Kickstarter isn't the first to experience backlash over a corporate move into the world of Web3. Discord, the online chat app, recently teased some features that would let users connect their crypto wallets with their account. The tool, shown in a tweet by CEO Jason Citron, was met with swift backlash. Some users raised concern over the potential for scams and money laundering in cryptocurrencies and NFTs, while others slammed the vast amount of energy required to process transactions on the blockchain. \"We have no current plans to ship this internal concept,\" Citron said in response. \"For now we're focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale. More soon.\" What it means Large companies and investors with deep pockets are raving about Web3. But there's a disconnect between how tech and finance industry professionals view crypto and the perception of the technology from the general public. With crypto, the primary use case among consumers continues to be speculative trading. And there is still a huge education gap. According to the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, 69% of people under the age of 40 don't realize crypto isn't a regulated product. \"There's clearly a goldrush\u2026leading to speculative investment,\" David Chaum, an American computer scientist and digital cash pioneer, told CNBC by email. Chaum is best known for inventing a system of untraceable electronic cash in the 1980s called e-cash. \"General skepticism about 'crypto' and digital currency has existed for as long as I can remember \u2014 long before bitcoin,\" Chaum said. He thinks people's distrust of crypto today will ease once the market matures. Several major companies, including Tesla, PayPal and Meta, have taken the plunge into crypto lately. Such moves have helped drive the price of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies higher this year, with investors betting on their potential to reach mainstream acceptance. But if Kickstarter and Discord's attempts to move into the market show anything, it's that this goal is still a long way off from becoming a reality."

Elizabeth Holmes attend the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit cocktail party at The Ferry Building on October 6, 2015 in San Francisco, California. Michael Kovac | Getty Images Eighteen years after he invested and lost $150,000 in Theranos, Marc Ostrofsky says he found a way to cash in. And he's going to use embattled Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes' notoriety. Ostrofsky will be auctioning his worthless Series A stock certificate for 500,000 shares signed by Holmes as a nonfungible token. \"I may be the only investor to make money off of Theranos when all is said and done,\" Ostrofsky said. The Houston-based tech investor said he met Holmes through his banker around the time she dropped out of Stanford in 2003. He was pitched the idea over a dinner meeting with Holmes. \"She was very smart and she knew what she was doing,\" Ostrofsky said. \"She was very good at pitching and had strong convictions in what she believed.\" That led to Ostrofsky investing $100,000 in 2004 and another $50,000 a few years later. For those investments he received two stock certificates in the private company. They are now worthless. Fast forward to earlier this month at Art Basel in Miami. Ostrofsky, who's a big art collector, said he got the idea to sell one of his stock certificates when he was talking to the exhibitors. \"I think this is exactly what an NFT should be,\" Ostrofsky said. \"Fun and a collectible. One of a kind.\" watch now VIDEO1:0001:00 Early Theranos investor to sell company stock certificate as NFT, banking on Elizabeth Holmes' fame News Videos The NFT, which will be titled \"Rise and Fall of Theranos NFT,\" will launch Thursday on digital art market OpenSea. The NFT offering comes as Holmes' case is expected to go to the jury by Friday after closing arguments are finished. Holmes has been fighting 11 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors allege Holmes engaged in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors and patients. Holmes has pleaded not guilty. Ostrofsky, who unlike other investors never sued Holmes or Theranos, said he hopes to recoup his investment multiple times over with the NFT offering. In the NFT world where digital assets are going for insane prices, Ostrovsky's optimistic projections may not be far off, according to Christine Parlour, finance professor at the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business. \"Art is in the eye of the beholder,\" Parlour said. \"There's a huge power in these NFTs. With Elizabeth Holmes, everyone knows the story so it's probably very personal for a lot of people and that adds a sort of sentimental value.\" As far as Holmes and the blood-testing technology she touted as a game changer, Ostrofsky said: \"I invest hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, that's what investments are. But I certainly did not see all of this coming.\" The winning bidder will also receive a token that can be redeemed for the physical stock certificate. Ostrofsky said unlike Holmes' ill-fated vision to run hundreds of tests with a drop or two of blood, there's no downside to this business venture. \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained,\" Ostrofsky said. \"It's not like I'm going to lose a fortune. I've lost my money in Theranos, this is the opposite. This is a recoup.\" watch now VIDEO1:5301:53 Elizabeth Holmes' trial nears completion The News with Shepard Smith"

Katie Haun, who became Andreessen's first female general partner in 2018, said her fund will launch next year with a focus on cryptocurrency and blockchain start-ups. Haun, a former federal prosecutor, helped raise multiple cryptocurrency-focused funds at Andreessen. The firm has been plowing money into start-ups and projects this year, and already fully deployed its latest $2.2 billion fund raised in June, according to Axios. Haun co-launched Andreessen's crypto funds with Chris Dixon, who will stay on and lead the firm's blockchain investments, alongside three other partners. \"When Chris and I started our first crypto fund in 2018, it was a moonshot experiment,\" Haun wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \"Thanks to the hard work of many, it has exceeded both of our wildest expectations. Today, it's more apparent than ever that web3 will transform the internet.\" Haun is heading out on her own as crypto investing moves beyond bitcoin and digital currencies and takes on broader significance in what techies are describing as the next wave of the internet, called Web3 or Web 3.0. She said she will keep her board seats at Andreessen's portfolio companies, including OpenSea and Coinbase. Andreessen Horowitz will be a limited partner in Haun's new fund. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the firm's founders, and Dixon will all personally contribute to Haun's new endeavor. Known for early bets on companies like Instagram, Lyft, Pinterest and Slack, Andreessen Horowitz made its first foray into digital assets through Coinbase in 2013. Its first official crypto-focused fund launched three years ago, during what's now known as \"crypto winter.\" That year, the value of bitcoin cratered roughly 80% from the highs in 2017. Bitcoin is up about 700% since Andreessen announced its first crypto fund, and was trading above $49,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.

DeFi is a rapidly-growing part of the cryptocurrency market that promises to deliver traditional financial products like loans and savings accounts without involvement from regulated middlemen such as banks. But regulators are increasingly concerned about platforms offering DeFi services that may not be as \"decentralized\" as advertised. \"What we found is that, first, the decentralized aspect tends to be illusive,\" Agustín Carstens, general manager of the BIS, told CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum Tuesday. \"There are some incentive issues related to the fact that, through this decentralization, at some point you end up with some agents that play an important role, and not necessarily for the best [interests] of users of financial services.\" watch now VIDEO9:2409:24 What is DeFi, and could it upend finance as we know it? Crypto The central bank group did not mention any specific names related to its concerns. The BIS said DeFi must be \"properly regulated\" in order to safeguard investors and boost trust in the market. Timo Lehes, a co-founder of decentralized crypto exchange Swarm Markets, accepted there was progress to be made in DeFi but said numerous institutions in the space are already working to address the systemic issues flagged by the BIS. \"Ultimately, each protocol will face the decision of whether to transition to a compliant business model,\" Lehes said in an emailed note Tuesday. watch now VIDEO4:0804:08 BIS: Central bankers forced to be market makers of last resort Street Signs Europe \"There's much to gain from operating within regulatory frameworks established to protect investors and maintain access to markets.\" Many DeFi services are built on top of Ethereum, the blockchain network behind ether, the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency. Transactions are facilitated through so-called smart contracts, which automate various processes through lines of code. More than $100 billion worth of funds is currently sitting on Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, according to data from crypto news and research firm The Block. Some of the biggest platforms in the space include Maker, Curve and Compound. DeFi sites are luring in investors with the promise of huge returns on their loans and savings. But they are increasingly being targeted by hackers and fraudsters. According to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, over $10 billion has been lost to DeFi scams and thefts so far in 2021. The BIS said it believes the risks around DeFi have currently been contained to crypto markets but that, going forward, \"the growth of DeFi poses financial stability concerns.\" The group flagged \"severe\" vulnerabilities with the industry, including highly-leveraged trades, liquidity issues and a lack of shock absorbers such as banks. \"It's important that we as authorities don't feel complacent,\" Carstens said. \"There might be aspects that are safe but there are also some aspects that are not, and I think that should make us think seriously about it.\""

Lam Yik | Bloomberg | Getty Images MIAMI BEACH, Fla. \u2013 Even if NFTs are a flash in the pan, cryptocurrency investors are betting that the underlying blockchain technology is here to stay. Crypto enthusiasts and venture capitalists flocked to Miami Beach, Florida this week during one of the world's premier art events. For the first time, Art Basel Miami featured multiple NFT exhibits. But the city also hosted upwards of 200 other events, where the focus was more on the technology behind these digital collectibles. Musicians, artists and celebrities are clamoring to launch NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which are unique digital assets with ownership rights verified and stored on a blockchain. It's a way to have ownership over content that's been historically easy to replicate online. The new asset class is raking in roughly $2 billion per month, up from $400 million in January, according to recent estimates from JPMorgan. Analysis by DappRadar shows NFT volume skyrocketing 38,000% year-over-year to $10.7 billion in the third quarter. \"Certainly there's a lot of hype,\" said Mike Shinoda, musician and co-founder of the band Linkin Park, who launched a new NFT mixtape this week. \"Most people believe there's some version of a bubble happening. But most of us who are in the space think that whether it goes up or down, it's a new thing that's here to stay in some version of itself.\" Gateway to crypto Tristan Yver, head of strategy at Miami-based FTX U.S. said the hype benefits all corners of the crypto industry, even if parts are overvalued. Digital art can be a less intimidating way to introduce people to blockchain technology, according to Yver. \"We all have some basic understanding of art. We don't all have a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain \u2014 it's the next step towards mass adoption,\" Yver told CNBC. \"NFTs are the first time a lot of people create a connection with cryptocurrency and blockchain.\" Blockchain technology used to be synonymous with bitcoin. But in the past few years, a variety of other blockchains have popped up that now support things like finance applications and video games. Also known as distributed ledgers, the main draw for building on a blockchain is that they're \"decentralized.\" There's no central authority controlling these networks and no single point of failure. Advocates say it's more transparent. Some tech investors see it as the next wave of the internet, dubbing it \"Web 3.0\". Adam Judd, head of crypto at LionTree, said some specific NFT projects feel \"somewhat bubbly.\" But he still sees room for growth in the category and new use cases around identity, community incentives, start-up funding, entertainment and fashion. He pointed to the cultural phenomena of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Beeple's record $69 million NFT sale driving \"immense interest\" in Web 3.0. \"One of the biggest opportunities right now is around user-friendly interfaces and experiences for the everyday person that make NFTs approachable, valuable, and economical,\" Judd said. \"Once the everyday person feels as comfortable purchasing an NFT as they do buying a coffee, the rest of Web3 will benefit.\" Packy McCormick, founder of Not Boring Capital, was also in Miami this week and said NFT events were the key catalyst for getting like-minded people in the same room. But conversations were drifting more towards decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, a new type of governance system, and other new use cases for blockchains. \"Once people get into NFTs, they want to learn about everything else going on in blockchain \u2014 it's impossible not to go down the rabbit hole,\" McCormick said. \"There's going to be a ton of people coming in to speculate. But the important projects will have staying power and over time, quality will win.\" \u2014 CNBC's Ritika Shah contributed to this report.

Jack Dorsey's payments giant said in an announcement that the new name, effective Dec. 10, \"acknowledges the company's growth\" and \"creates room for further growth.\" Block will still trade under the ticker SQ on the New York Stock Exchange. \"We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,\" Dorsey, cofounder and CEO, said in a statement. \"Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.\" Jack Dorsey (L), CEO of Square and CEO of Twitter, live casts video while standing outside the New York Stock Exchange for the IPO of Square, in New York November 19, 2015. Lucas Jackson | Reuters Dorsey co-founded Square in 2009 with a focus on in-person payments and its namesake card reader, which let people accept credit card payments on a smartphone. San Francisco-based Square has since added a peer-to-peer digital banking app and small business lending, received a bank charter and begun offering crypto and stock trading. The company has acquired buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay and Jay-Z's music streaming service Tidal. It's also doubling down on bitcoin with a crypto-focused business called TBD. As part of the Square rebrand, Square Crypto, a separate part of the company \"dedicated to advancing Bitcoin,\" will change its name to Spiral. The name Block \"has many associated meanings for the company \u2014 building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome,\" Block said in a statement. Dorsey stepped down from his other job as Twitter CEO on Monday after running both Twitter and Square since 2015. He said he believes Twitter is \"ready to move on from its founders\" and he will now have more time to dedicate to Square's growing portfolio. But Dorsey is also expected to focus on his fascination with cryptocurrency. The news comes roughly a month after Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to build a virtual world called the metaverse. Google famously renamed itself Alphabet six years ago in a similar move to reflect other lines of business. Square was one of the biggest winners of 2020 as consumers shifted to digital payments. Shares are down roughly 2% so far this year, as investors rotate away from higher-growth tech names. Correction: Square (now Block) trades on the NYSE."

The auction raised $5.4 million which Berners-Lee said would be donated to charity. Noam Galai | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images This Giving Tuesday, philanthropy is undergoing a tech revolution. NFTs, known for pushing the art and entertainment industries forward, are innovating in charitable giving as well, and some of the crypto community's biggest bulls and earliest backers are getting on board. Gemini, the cryptocurrency company founded by bitcoin billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, unveiled in February a \"Give Back with Crypto'' feature, giving Gemini wallet holders the opportunity to donate to over 300 nonprofits, courtesy of a three-year-old platform named The Giving Block. The Giving Block provides the technology stack to connect the crypto community with the philanthropic community, meaning that Gemini wallet holders, FTX users, and all of The Giving Block's other partners can donate any one of dozens of cryptocurrencies directly to a nonprofit of their choosing. The Giving Block has become one of the mainstays in crypto charitable giving, partnering with dozens of platforms and exchanges and hundreds of charities. And, trendy as they are, the logistics and tax implications of crypto donations aren't all that different from stock donations. Donating cryptocurrency isn't new; United Way was one of the first and largest nonprofits to start accepting bitcoin donations in 2014. Edwin Goutier, vice president of innovation for United Way, told CNBC that back then, \"We saw a growing thriving community of individuals who were passionate as well as a growing base of wealth.\" Donating NFTs Today, Goutier sees a similar rise with NFTs. Jack Dorsey famously sold his first tweet as an NFT and donated the proceeds to charity earlier this year, and CNBC's own 'Haines Bottom' NFT sold at auction for over $61,000 just a few months later. The Winklevii haven't slept on the NFTs for philanthropy model either. To commemorate the 13th anniversary of the bitcoin white paper, Gemini displayed over 100 phrases from the paper on a former CNN billboard in NYC's Columbus Circle. Each phrase sold as an NFT on the Gemini-owned Nifty Gateway, and all proceeds were donated. If donating cryptocurrency is akin to donating stock, Nifty Gateway COO Patrick McLaren says donating NFTs is analogous to donating physical goods, like a traditional piece of art or a similar high-value collectible. And, McLaren says, it's in the DNA of the crypto community. \"I recall when the blockchain industry was just becoming an industry, and it was all happening very, very quickly, it always struck me how much people wanted to give back.\" watch now VIDEO4:4904:49 How crypto could play into the metaverse Crypto Venture capitalist and longtime cryptocurrency optimist Bill Tai saw the charitable potential in NFTs early on. He was Zoom's first investor and an early Twitter and Tweetdeck backer, but he's also backed DapperLabs, the company behind NBA TopShot and CryptoKitties. In 2018, he commissioned what eventually became the first NFT for charity: Honu Kitty, a part cat, part turtle that yielded $25,000 for marine conservation. Now three years later, Tai has set up Metagood, an NFT marketplace that enables donations for each NFT drop. Metagood's investors include Owen Wilson; Richard Branson's children Holly and Sam Branson; Charlie Lee, inventor of Litecoin; and Woody Harrelson. Metagood is one of many social impact NFT projects to launch this year. Binance launched the NFT for Good collection over the summer, benefiting charities for children. OpenSea has hosted charitable drops, and DoinGud, an NFT marketplace with a donation requirement for each sale, launches for the public on Tuesday. The charitable opportunity in crypto and NFTs isn't occurring without a related opportunity for the new platforms to make money. While many in crypto emphasize community as the industry's standout feature, more use of crypto means a bigger market overall. \"Any time you have a community of interest, you have the ability to create commerce, and a currency,\" Tai said. How charities view the blockchain The NFT donation appeal for charities, and for donors, lay less in the novelty of the blockchain and more in its long term impact. The royalties that attracted the likes of Steve Aoki, Kings of Leon, and Gary Vaynerchuk to the NFT ecosystem are also attracting nonprofits who see the NFT's secondary and tertiary markets as opportunities for donations in perpetuity. Built on the Polygon blockchain, DoinGud allows artists to determine how much of the token's proceeds go to charity, as well as which charity the sales will benefit. The platform is, for now, allowing no less than a 5% allocation in the primary market, and the donations from the secondary market sales are determined in each NFT's individual smart contract. The default, says co-founder and curator Kyle Gordon, is a donation of 2.5% in the secondary market. Since NFTs, like traditional art and collectible assets, accrue value over time, Goutier says the potential in this new donation model is in part why the nonprofit agreed to work with DoinGud. \"We'll have the opportunity to receive a portion of secondary market sales,\" he said. As the original NFT increases in value, so does the donation, and the nonprofit first chosen by the creator benefits with every transaction, forever. The benefits are monetary, certainly, but also cultural. With each transaction, the nonprofit reups its relevance. \"It's a sustainable donation model,\" Goutier said. For artists, NFT profits are typically blunted by notorious gas and transaction fees, and donating a cut of proceeds may not seem feasible for newer creators. To combat that, DoinGud has instead put gas and minting fees on the collectors, offering creators a chance to retain 95% of their sale's proceeds. Like all things crypto, though, it's still early days. While United Way has accepted crypto donations for seven years, cryptocurrencies still comprise an extremely small amount of its $4.8 billion raised annually \u2014 Goutier estimates less than 1%. NFTs may very well help raise that number, but nonprofits are now considering other implications of their corporate wallets. \"Do we keep crypto on our balance sheet?\" Goutier said. The Giving Block has launched its own version of Giving Tuesday: NFTuesday, scheduled for December 7, in conjunction with the Sotheby's auction benefiting Sostento, a nonprofit for health-care workers. The two are touting the upcoming event as the \"biggest NFT charity auction ever.\""

Garlinghouse said he expects the case, which centers on XRP, the world's seventh-biggest cryptocurrency, will likely reach a conclusion next year. \"We're seeing pretty good progress despite a slow-moving judicial process,\" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy. \"Clearly we're seeing good questions asked by the judge. And I think the judge realizes this is not just about Ripple, this will have broader implications.\" Garlinghouse said he was hopeful there would be closure next year. Ripple, which is based in San Francisco, generated a lot of buzz during the crypto frenzy of late 2017 and 2018, which saw the prices of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies skyrocket to record highs.

The company also markets another product that utilizes XRP for cross-border payments called On-Demand Liquidity. The SEC is concerned about Ripple's ties to XRP, alleging the company and its executives sold $1.3 billion worth of the tokens in an unregistered securities offering. But Ripple contends that XRP should not be considered a security, a classification that would bring it under much more regulatory scrutiny. It comes as regulators around the world are taking a closer look at crypto, a market that is still largely unregulated but has boomed in the last year. Garlinghouse said the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Singapore and Switzerland are examples of countries showing \"leadership\" when it comes to regulating crypto, while China and India have cracked down on the industry. \"In general, the direction of travel is very positive,\" Garlinghouse said. Brady Dougan, the former CEO of Credit Suisse, said regulation is a key area in crypto that's likely to develop over time. \"It's a market that's early in its development,\" Dougan, who now runs fintech firm Exos, told CNBC. \"I think it's a healthy market and it's one that will continue to develop in a positive way.\" Ripple, a privately-held company, was last valued at $10 billion and counts the likes of Alphabet's venture capital arm GV, Andreessen Horowitz and Japan's SBI Holdings as investors.

Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images Cryptocurrency start-ups have raised record funding this year. It's no surprise, then, that some major players in the space \u2014 from the Winklevoss twins' virtual currency exchange Gemini to Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin's blockchain start-up ConsenSys \u2014 announced massive new funding deals in the last week. MoonPay, a relative newcomer, is taking the crypto mania in venture capital to new heights. The three-year-old fintech firm said Monday it has raised $555 million in its first-ever financing round. The investment, led by Tiger Global and Coatue, values the company at $3.4 billion. Founded in 2018, Miami-based MoonPay's software lets users buy and sell cryptocurrencies using conventional payment methods like credit cards, bank transfers or mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay. It also sells its technology to other businesses including crypto website Bitcoin.com and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, a model CEO Ivan Soto-Wright calls \"crypto-as-a-service.\" Soto-Wright said the firm aims to make crypto accessible to the masses in the same way that video-conferencing tools like Zoom made it easier to make calls over the internet. watch now VIDEO4:1604:16 Crypto and digital markets are healthy and will continue to develop in positive way, Exos CEO says Squawk Box Europe \"With the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, I think right now we are still in the dial-up days,\" he told CNBC in an interview. \"Eventually we will get to this place where it's frictionless to move any amount of value around anywhere in the world, and costs move as close as possible to zero.\" 'PayPal for crypto' With prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hitting all-time highs lately, venture capital investment in the start-ups powering the market is booming. Investors are looking for the next Coinbase after the crypto exchange giant's blockbuster listing in April. MoonPay's pitch to investors is that it offers a \"gateway\" to digital assets. For now, that includes bitcoin, ether and other digital tokens like NFTs. But Soto-Wright's vision is to expand the platform to include everything from digital fashion to tokenized stocks. \"People are calling us similar to PayPal, but for crypto,\" he said. The company has strong controls and checks in place to tackle money laundering, Soto-Wright said. Regulators have become increasingly wary about illicit activity in the market. MoonPay says it has been profitable since launching its platform in 2019. The firm is on track to hit $150 million in annual revenue this year after transaction volumes skyrocketed 35-fold from 2020. Its service is now used by more than 7 million customers. Still, the company faces stiff competition, not least from fintech pioneers like PayPal, which rolled out its own crypto features last year. Soto-Wright said he's not worried about the competition. He described PayPal as a \"walled garden\" that doesn't give users control over their assets. \"We believe the future of crypto is about customers taking possession of their private keys,\" passwords that grant people access to their funds, he said. IPO ambitions Looking ahead, MoonPay plans to spend the money raised on new products and expansion. Soto-Wright said the firm already has ambitions to take the business public. \"We have aspirations eventually to be a public company,\" he said. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, however, and that has impacted even the most well-known players in the space. Coinbase, for example, missed sales estimates in the third quarter after a drop in monthly users. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $69,000 earlier this month, but has since dropped about 17%. Ether, meanwhile, is down 13% from its record high. watch now VIDEO3:0303:03 Bitcoin 'has inflation resistance characteristics,' says Wisdom Tree Squawk Box Europe Soto-Wright said MoonPay is prepared for a potential downturn in crypto markets, adding the firm is \"agnostic\" on which assets it supports. \"In the same way that telecoms got disrupted by voice over IP (internet protocol), we think, over time, financial services and all these different applications will be disrupted by the blockchain,\" he said. \"There's obviously going to be volatility as the market is trying to discover what assets, what blockchains are ultimately going to get adopted.\""

I had this level, I had an entry point.\" He subsequently held on to his position until late 2020, when bitcoin regained the $19,000 level. A few months later, bitcoin extended its wild run, hitting a record high above $60,000. Bitcoin continues to trade above the $60,000 mark. The cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high of more than $68,000 last week. It was last trading at about $60,718, down 5% in the last 24 hours, according to Coin Metrics data. Analysts have pointed to inflation fears and the launch of the first U.S. bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund as key factors driving the rally. Meanwhile, bitcoin's underlying blockchain underwent a major upgrade over the weekend. Still, bitcoin and its smaller competitors \u2014 which include ethereum and XRP \u2014 are notoriously volatile assets. Bitcoin at one point halved in price after initially topping $60,000 as Chinese regulators stepped up a crackdown on crypto mining and trading. \"You really don't want to ask me about valuations, because I don't quite understand why $60,000, as opposed to $68,000, is the right level,\" El-Erian added. When to buy again El-Erian categorizes bitcoin investors into three buckets: \"fundamentalists\" who are in it for the long haul, professional investors looking to diversify their portfolios and day trading \"speculators.\" The economist said he would only feel comfortable buying again once some of the speculators in the market are \"shaken out.\" The first two types of investors, he says, are \"really strong foundations for that market long term.\" Mohamed El-Erian Olivia Michael | CNBC \"These other two levels are pretty solid in terms of supporting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,\" El-Erian said. \"The key thing here is the underlying technology and the model. And those two things are going to be very influential in the period ahead.\" Like bitcoin's evangelists, El-Erian believes the cryptocurrency is a \"very disruptive force.\" But he doesn't think it will ever become a \"global currency\" rivaling the U.S. dollar. \"I think it will always exist in the ecosystem but it's not going to be a global currency,\" he said. \"It's not going to replace the dollar.\" Unlike crypto skeptics, however, the former Pimco CEO doesn't believe bitcoin can be \"regulated out of existence.\" If the West is not careful, China will define standards for the world. Mohamed El-Erian Chief Economic Advisor, Allianz As more and more mainstream investors jump into the market, El-Erian thinks the crypto industry should start engaging with regulators sooner rather than later to avoid the regulatory headwinds facing internet giants like Amazon, Google and Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook. \"When I speak to people in the crypto industry, I say you have a responsibility not to repeat the mistake of Big Tech,\" El-Erian said. \"The big mistake of Big Tech was they didn't realize they were becoming systemically important, so they didn't engage in preemptive regulatory discussions.\" \"Crypto needs to take seriously that there are concerns about illicit payments; there's concerns about fraud; there's concerns about stability of platform,\" he added. El-Erian warned China may look to get ahead of the U.S. and other countries in the West on digital currency and blockchain technology. While the world's second-largest economy has largely banned cryptocurrency-related activities, it has ambitious plans to issue its own central bank digital currency and to apply the blockchain technology that underpins many cryptocurrencies in other fields, such as intellectual property. \"If the West is not careful, China will define standards for the world,\" El-Erian said."

        "detailedArticleContent": "China's digital yuan currency is displayed on a mobile phone in Yichang, Hubei province, China, Feb. 22, 2021. Costfoto | Barcroft Media | Getty Images Don't expect central banks to issue their own digital currencies anytime soon \u2014 that was the message from the Bank of England this week. The U.K. central bank on Tuesday said it was advancing its exploration of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, to a consultation stage that's due to take place next year. But even if it decides to push ahead with the proposed digital currency, which has been dubbed \"Britcoin,\" it's unlikely to arrive until at least 2025, the BOE said. And even then, that's only if it's found to be \"operationally and technologically robust.\" Anne Boden, CEO of London-based digital bank Starling, said a key question that's still not been answered is which problem Britcoin is trying to solve. Boden is one of several industry executives providing input to U.K. officials as they explore CBDCs. \"Everything we do in this space has to solve a real problem,\" Boden told CNBC last week. \"It has to have uptake and needs to be ubiquitous enough in order to provide some real value.\" Rising interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has reignited central banks' ambitions to develop their own digital currencies lately. But so far, most CBDC projects are moving at a sluggish pace. Sweden, which was early to the CBDC game, says it hopes to have a digital version of its krona by 2026. In China, on the other hand, the central bank is racing ahead with its own CBDC project, rolling out a virtual version of the yuan in trials across several provinces. Experts say the People's Bank of China is likely to be the first to fully launch a CBDC. But the PBOC's digital yuan comes with a number of problems that make it less attractive in Western countries. Critics say it's too centralized and could be used to boost government surveillance. That's because, unlike cash, people's digital transactions can be tracked online. 'Massively overhyped' Garrick Hileman, head of research at crypto company Blockchain.com and visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said talk of central bank-issued digital currencies mimics the hype around blockchain in late 2017, when bitcoin's price experienced a seismic rally before plunging sharply. Several major banks had talked up the huge potential for blockchain, the distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies. But they snubbed the idea of bitcoin and other digital coins becoming a mainstream financial phenomenon. \"I think CBDCs right now are running the risk of being massively overhyped and under-delivering,\" Hileman said. \"The questions that need to be discussed to design an effective CBDC \u2014 like privacy, like surveillance \u2014 are things that are way above the paygrade of every central banker.\" There are plenty of issues to be ironed out in the development of CBDCs \u2014 not least when it comes to ensuring privacy and avoiding financial censorship. watch now VIDEO7:5107:51 How the Facebook digital currency dream has changed International Digital Originals Bankers also worry CBDCs could undermine their role in the financial system, resulting in the increased risk of a \"bank run.\" Consumers may flock to place their deposits with central banks directly, rather than keeping their money at the bank. \"Even if you think you've got the perfect mouse trap to head off a run from HSBC and Natwest into the Bank of England's perceived safety, until that's battle tested we just don't know,\" Hileman said. Nevertheless, whichever form \"Britcoin\" and other CBDCs inevitably take, there's no doubt about the move from analog to digital. \"We've been talking about CBDCs for years now,\" said Hileman. \"This is now firmly on the radar for central banks.\" Boden said she hopes the Bank of England doesn't wait too long to evaluate the potential for a U.K. CBDC. \"The world is moving on,\" she said. \"The U.K. has been at the forefront of lots of new payment systems in the past.\" \"If something new is going to happen in the space, I very much hope the Bank of England's there thinking about it soon, rather than later.\""

Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto | Getty Images Shiba inu, a dogecoin spinoff, is close to surpassing Elon Musk's favorite cryptocurrency. The digital token has surged 30% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko, hitting a record high above $0.00006. It has more than doubled in price in the last week. With a market capitalization of more than $29 billion, shiba inu is now the 11th-largest cryptocurrency. Dogecoin is the 10th biggest, with a market cap of $31 billion. Dogecoin was down 11% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. What is shiba inu? Shiba inu is a so-called meme token that bills itself as a \"dogecoin killer.\" It takes its branding from the same internet meme dogecoin is based on, using the image of a Japanese shiba inu dog. The token was created in August 2020 by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Ryoshi.\" The coin's creator describes shiba inu in a white paper \u2014 or, in this case, \"woofpaper\" \u2014 as \"an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building.\" Shiba inu is based on the Ethereum blockchain, which has become a go-to for numerous new token projects and a fast-growing trend known as \"decentralized finance,\" which aims to replicate traditional financial products like lending and trading. watch now VIDEO2:0002:00 Dog breeders are fetching mad coin for dogecoin's mascot \u2014 Meet the Japanese Shiba Inu TechCheck The rise of meme coins like dogecoin and shiba inu mimics the GameStop saga that took place earlier this year, when a flood of retail traders inspired by a Reddit forum piled into the video game retailer's stock, leading to wild swings in the price. In a similar vein, amateur traders have looked to little-known cryptocurrencies in the hope of achieving outsized gains. Shiba inu's creator claims not to hold any tokens. The cryptocurrency has a total supply of 1 quadrillion, according to data from CoinGecko. In May, Ryoshi sent half of the coin's supply to Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, who sent 50 trillion of the tokens to an Indian Covid relief fund. Buterin then destroyed most of his holdings and donated the rest to charity. Why is it rallying? Crypto traders have been speculating about whether online trading firm Robinhood could add shiba inu to its platform. Believers in shiba inu are pushing hard for Robinhood to list the token. They have started a petition on Change.org, which has now reached more than 300,000 signatures. So far, Robinhood hasn't actually said publicly whether it will support shiba inu. watch now VIDEO3:5603:56 What are NFTs? CNBC Explains Robinhood on Tuesday missed revenue expectations for the third quarter after a big drop in crypto trading volume. Shares of Robinhood were down more than 10% in early Wednesday trading. The online brokerage got a big boost from digital currency trading in the second quarter, with dogecoin accounting for 62% of its crypto revenue during the period. The shiba inu community has also dropped a number of NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, known as \"shiboshis.\" NFTs are a type of digital asset that tracks ownership of virtual collectible items like art or sports memorabilia. Cryptocurrencies have been known to undergo wild bouts of volatility. Bitcoin, which recently hit a record high above $66,000, halved in price earlier this year after Chinese regulators clamped down on the country's crypto industry. Meanwhile, dogecoin, which had a huge rally earlier this year, is currently down 68% from its record high set in early May."

        "detailedArticleContent": "Worldcoin's orb-shaped devices scan people's eyes in exchange for cryptocurrency. Worldcoin It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie \u2014 metallic orbs that scan people's eyes to pay them in digital currency. That's what tech investor Sam Altman has been working on for his new start-up, a company called Worldcoin. Launched out of \"stealth\" on Thursday, Worldcoin promises to hand out free cryptocurrency to people who verify their accounts by taking an iris scan. Worldcoin says it's already attracted $25 million in funding from Silicon Valley investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase and billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, giving the firm a $1 billion valuation. Altman, CEO of artificial intelligence group OpenAI and former president of start-up accelerator Y Combinator, co-founded the company with theoretical physics student Alex Blania and Max Novendstern, a former investment associate at Bridgewater Associates. The idea seems outlandish at first. Free money? And all I need to do is have my eyes scanned? It sounds too good to be true. However, Worldcoin's founders say it's about expanding the reach of cryptocurrencies \u2014 and financial services more broadly \u2014 to the masses. Less than 3% of the global population are crypto users, according to virtual currency exchange Crypto.com. \"Cryptocurrency is a very powerful thing,\" Blania, Worldcoin's CEO, told CNBC. \"It will widen the boundaries of the economy in general and give many people access.\" How it works Worldcoin has already shipped its orb-shaped devices to people in 12 countries. Testers get users to sign up by having their iris scanned. The image is then encrypted and becomes a unique code, while the original data is deleted to protect users' privacy. Following that, users are given a free share of Worldcoin's cryptocurrency. A tester operating one of Worldcoin's orbs in Chile. Source: Worldcoin \"We designed the whole system to be fundamentally privacy-preserving,\" Blania said. \"The iris code itself is the only thing leaving the orb. There's no big database of biometric data.\" The company has so far amassed over 100,000 users globally already, and is onboarding 700 more each week. Worldcoin aims to hit 1 billion users by 2023. Which raises a big question \u2014 how exactly is Worldcoin meant to be used? Well, one early feature of the project will be a digital wallet that lets users store their crypto and make payments. But more broadly, Blania hopes to attract developers who can build apps on top of its system; apps \"that we don't see today and that are really hard to build today because very few people hold crypto.\" \"Network effects are these very coveted things that are incredibly big,\" Blania said. \"You see this in Facebook. As soon as you suddenly have a billion people and everyday people holding something like that and using something like that, you as an entrepreneur can build completely new things.\" One issue Worldcoin encountered early on, Blania says, is ensuring that people aren't able to cheat the system. He calls this problem \"proof of person.\" \"The only solution for that problem, we found, was to build an orb,\" Worldcoin's boss said. \"It's the most secure and privacy-preserving way we found to prove everyone in the world is unique.\" 'Infrastructure' for basic income It's a concept that has parallels to a universal basic income, or UBI, which has been promoted by Altman and several other high-profile figures in tech. The idea is that, by handing out cash regularly to citizens for free, governments can mitigate the impacts of artificial intelligence and automation on workers. Blania hinted that Worldcoin could be used as the \"infrastructure\" to carry out UBI at some point in the future.\" Worldcoin co-founders Sam Altman and Alex Blania. Worldcoin \"I'm personally very excited about UBI over the long term,\" Blania said. \"I think it's a very hard thing to implement right now.\" \"We see ourselves as building this huge network of people where entrepreneurs can jump in and build applications like this. UBI is one of those, but building big financial, global companies is another big one.\" Worldcoin isn't the only far-out project Altman has thrown his weight behind. In 2018, the millionaire tech entrepreneur paid $10,000 to a start-up called Nectome to have his brain preserved, scanned and uploaded into a computer simulation. Crypto boom Worldcoin has built its system on Ethereum, the blockchain network behind the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Blania hopes to tap into a fast-growing trend in crypto known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, which seeks to cut the middlemen out of traditional financial processes like lending and investing. Worldcoin's launch comes at a time of renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as the prices of bitcoin and other digital coins have surged lately. Bitcoin, the world's largest virtual currency, notched a fresh record high above $66,000 on Wednesday, while ether, XRP and other tokens also climbed sharply. Cryptocurrencies have gained a reputation for their involvement in fraudulent activity, with various pump-and-dump schemes duping amateur investors into buying tokens, only for the creators and insiders to make off with millions. But Blania insists Worldcoin isn't a scam. \"We are extremely transparent about everything we do,\" he said. \"We will open source everything that is possible to open source.\""

The cryptocurrency exchange said Tuesday it plans to launch a marketplace that lets users mint, collect and trade NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. Users can sign up to a waitlist for early access to the feature, the company said. NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets designed to represent ownership of online items like rare art or collectible trading cards. They aren't fungible, meaning you can't exchange one NFT for another like you could with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sales of such tokens have boomed this year. The NFT market topped $10 billion in transaction volume in the third quarter of 2021, according to DappRadar, a company that tracks data on crypto-based applications. Notable purchases include the almost $70 million someone shelled out for a digital collage made by Mike Winkelmann, the artist known as Beeple, and the nearly $3 million another person paid for the first-ever tweet. Coinbase said its NFT marketplace, called Coinbase NFT, would include \"social features\" and tap into the so-called creator economy, a term used to describe the world of people who make money posting videos and other content online. watch now VIDEO3:5603:56 What are NFTs? CNBC Explains Advocates say NFTs are a way to fairly compensate artists who've seen their income decline due to the widespread availability of media online. Critics, on the other hand, view them as another speculative bubble in the crypto market that's waiting to burst. Still, a move into the NFT space could be a way for Coinbase to branch out into new revenue streams \u2014 the company is currently heavily reliant on exchange fees. It would also pit the firm against other crypto start-ups like Gemini, Binance and OpenSea, which is backed by early Coinbase investor Andreessen Horowitz. Last month, OpenSea admitted insider trading took place on its platform. The company is by far the biggest NFT marketplace, according to DappRadar."

Online banking companies like Chime and SoFi provide the service as part of a broad portfolio of products, while PayPal and stock trading app Robinhood also let users deposit their paychecks. Coinbase is rolling out new offerings while simultaneously trying to navigate a complicated regulatory environment. Last week, the company canceled plans for a high-interest lending product after the SEC threatened to sue over it. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called it \"really sketchy behavior coming out of the SEC recently.\" Armstrong also said the agency refused to meet with the company, and gave \"zero explanation as to why.\" SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has sharpened his criticism of the cryptocurrency industry. In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month, Gensler called for more crypto oversight. He also asked for additional resources from Congress to ensure investor protection and contended that most digital assets traded need to register with the agency. Coinbase went public in April through a direct listing. The stock has dropped 40% since its debut, trading at $229.40 on Monday. Its moves often mirror the volatility of bitcoin, which is down 28% over the same stretch.

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a new but fast-growing phenomenon in the crypto industry. They are digital tokens that represent ownership of a virtual item, such as a work of art. Ownership is tracked on the blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions. watch now VIDEO3:5603:56 What are NFTs? CNBC Explains Unlike bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, NFTs aren't fungible. This means they cannot be exchanged with one another like dollars or gold. Each NFT is unique and acts as a collector's item that can't be duplicated \u2014 however, the underlying media can still be viewed by someone else on the internet. \"When we think about the collectibles in the physical world, most of them have no utility value,\" Nicolas Julia, CEO and cop-founder of Sorare, explained. \"You put them in an album and that's nice but it's kind of limiting.\" \"When you translate it to NFTs in the digital world, there's many more things which you can do, like using them in a game for instance. But you also have provable scarcity, which is very appealing to collectors.\" Prices of NFTs spiked earlier this year, with sales reaching a record $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021. High-profile transactions include a record $69 million artwork sold by digital artist Beeple at a Christie's auction and the $2.9 million sale of the first-ever tweet by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The huge sums of money flowing into firms like Dapper Labs and Sorare highlights how investors are chasing the next big thing in crypto. Crypto and blockchain start-ups have received about $19 billion in venture funding so far this year, almost triple the $6.4 billion raised by the sector in 2020, according to figures shared with CNBC by data firm Pitchbook. However, like other assets in the fledgling crypto industry, NFTs have proven vulnerable to abuse by bad actors. Last week, digital collectibles marketplace OpenSea disclosed that insider trading had occurred on its platform. NFTs enter the world of sport Several sports organizations are turning to NFTs and other crypto assets as a way of making additional revenue. English Premier League club Manchester City, for example, has launched two collections of NFTs. Meanwhile, a number of soccer clubs have launched \"fan tokens\" that allow holders to vote on mostly minor club decisions and receive certain perks. Dapper Labs' NBA Top Shot platform lets users trade and collect basketball match highlights in the form of NFTs. The highlights, or \"moments,\" are licensed by the NBA, which receives royalties on each transaction. Dapper Labs also developed its own blockchain designed for NFTs, called Flow. It had previously used Ethereum but shifted away from that network after its popular digital pet game CryptoKitties in 2017 led to slower transaction processing. It's currently in the process of migrating CryptoKitties to Flow. watch now VIDEO6:1306:13 NBA Top Shot maker on the future of NFTs and the business opportunity Squawk Alley In addition to announcing its latest funding Wednesday, Dapper Labs unveiled a partnership with LaLiga, Spain's top soccer league, to introduce a similar experience to NBA Top Shot for soccer fans. Dapper Labs says it plans to invest part of the fresh cash into new experiences, like paid trips to big games. \"Part of this funding will go toward expanding functionality on NBA Top shot, developing a mobile product, and connecting the digital collecting experience with the experience of a fan showing up to a live game, or even supporting their team on social media,\" Roham Gharegozlou, Dapper Labs' CEO, told CNBC. It comes a week after LaLiga announced a separate partnership with Sorare to add digital player cards from the league. Sorare is also upping its rivalry with Dapper Labs, planning to expand into the U.S. with a new office on the ground. Sorare has been approached by a number of U.S. sports organizations, its CEO told CNBC. Sorare also plans to launch a mobile app and have all of the top 20 soccer leagues signed up by the end of 2022. Both Dapper Labs and Sorare indicated they hope to take advantage of sports stars' huge social media followings to get the word out about their platforms."

        "detailedArticleContent": "A smartphone and a screen show the website OpenSea, where digital artworks are sold using NFT. NFTs, non-fungible tokens, are unique cryptographic credentials that are written to the blockchain attached to a file (image, music, video). picture alliance | picture alliance | Getty Images The largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, is launching an app for users in the Google Play and Apple App Store on this week. The app rollout comes after a wildly busy month for the platform: in August, OpenSea's website saw two million transactions, totaling $3.4 billion in trading volume and tripling activity from July. So far in September, daily trading volume has dropped significantly from its peak in late August, according to Dune Analytics. Still, the app could build on the company's momentum, offering users a way to check non-fungible token holdings, sales, and trading histories easily on mobile. The app is expected to appear in app stores on Friday. OpenSea's app launch follows news that one of the company's employees participated in an NFT insider trading scheme. The company, valued at $1.5 billion, admitted to the incident, and co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer tweeted an apology to users on Wednesday: \"We're conducting a thorough review of yesterday's incident and are committed to doing the right thing for OpenSea users.\" In a statement to CNBC via email, Finzer wrote: \"I was incredibly disappointed by the news and this behavior does not represent our values at OpenSea. We are working with an outside law firm to conduct an internal review.\" So far, the company has garnered financial backing from big names in the crypto community, including Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, and Mark Cuban. At only four years old, OpenSea hit unicorn status with its latest funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz's a16z, with participation from Coatue, Ashton Kutcher, and Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke. OpenSea is riding the current wave of interest in non-fungible tokens \u2014 unique, collectible digital assets built on the blockchain. Flashy transactions like the $69 million Beeple sale at Christie's have captured the mainstream's attention, but for co-founders Finzer and Alex Atallah, as well as others in the space, the excitement resides in what's still possible. \"We are bringing a new technology to a mainstream audience,\" Finzer told CNBC. The company is focused on bringing consumers an experience that's \"quick, easy, and really fun at the end of the day.\" Sound familiar? Brokerage app Robinhood began with similar hopes of bringing a seemingly insular and highly guarded world to the masses, and in part, Finzer is comfortable with that comparison. Both OpenSea and Robinhood recognize that a smooth consumer experience is key to platforms operating in worlds that seem complicated to outsiders. The products are different, though: OpenSea, Finzer stressed, is a marketplace. OpenSea's website currently offers a place to buy, sell, explore, and show off NFT collections, and the app will feature integrations with social media and a feature to \"follow\" other users. watch now VIDEO5:0005:00 Digital artist, Beeple: NFTs are the next chapter of art history Marketing Media Money Harvard Business School associate professor Scott Duke Kominers emphasized consumer ease as a tenet of success for platforms in the NFT space. \"A lot of the most successful players are the ones that have submerged some of the crypto-ness of the system in ways that make the experience for the consumer feel more like a normal online purchasing experience,\" Kominers told CNBC. OpenSea competitors include Nifty Gateway, FTX, and Mintable. NFTs were originally touted as a way to support artists, and entrepreneurs like Gary Vaynerchuk have since seized digital collectibles as opportunities for branding, marketing, and advertising. \"It's all of the above,\" Finzer said. \"It's a brand new paradigm shift of the internet.\" Ticketing and gaming, as well as the art industry, could each find a home in the metaverse. Barriers to entry in the NFT space remain high, according to Kominers. Significant costs plus a long chain of mechanics are just two challenges for the industry players. Right now, aspiring NFT collectors must first open an account on a cryptocurrency exchange, open at least one crypto wallet, send money to a crypto exchange account, send that to the wallet, connect the wallet to the appropriate platform, pay a \"gas fee\" for the computing power that the transaction takes on the blockchain, and finally, buy the NFT in question, incurring yet another fee and risking transaction failure. The sheer length of the logistical process is enough to turn hesitant consumers off. Environmental impact is another sticking point for critics, who point to bitcoin's carbon footprint. According to Digiconomist, the carbon footprint for ethereum, the blockchain favored by the NFT space, is comparable to that of Denmark. Ethereum relies on a \"proof of work\" system that requires a large amount of processing power, but OpenSea co-founder and CTO Atallah points to the company's recent transition to the \"proof of stake\" polygon blockchain as one way to combat the metaverse's drain on energy resources. Kominers says there is plenty of risk for early leaders in the space. The first players in an industry aren't necessarily the most successful \u2014 take Vine and Tiktok, as an example. \"Your network has to be powerful enough to overcome competitors who later borrow the successful parts of your business model and target a slightly different audience.\" Still, he says total engagement is understated, which means NFTs, OpenSea, and its competitors, may still have room to run."

        "detailedArticleContent": "The SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich, Switzerland. Stefan Wermuth | Bloomberg via Getty Images SIX, Switzerland's stock exchange, has won regulatory approval to launch its long-awaited digital bourse. The SIX Digital Exchange said Friday it obtained two licenses from FINMA, the country's markets watchdog, to operate a stock exchange and depository for blockchain-based securities. SIX said it is now able to launch regulated trading, settlement and custody infrastructure based on distributed ledger technology \u2014 also known as the blockchain \u2014 the system best known for its use in maintaining an immutable list of all cryptocurrency transactions. The firm said it plans to offer stocks and bonds in the form of digital tokens once the new exchange is live. Thomas Zeeb, SIX's global head of exchanges, has hinted the company could also offer tokenized versions of exchange-traded funds as well as other assets like art and real estate. \"That could take a little longer depending on where the banks are,\" he told CNBC in a 2019 interview. SIX did not say when it expects the new product to launch. The digital bourse could provide a regulated alternative to cryptocurrency exchanges, many of which operate outside the confines of established rules. Binance, the world's top crypto exchange, has faced several warnings and threats from authorities around the world. Coinbase, which is a regulated business, attracted the ire of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently. The launch of SIX's new platform would see the company pull ahead of major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange in offering securities based on the blockchain, although SIX says it doesn't plan to support bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Landmark move Still, the approval marks a milestone in the world of cryptocurrencies, which have been seeing growing acceptance from several big companies and even an entire nation as their prices have surged. PayPal, Square and Mastercard are among the large financial firms to have offered support for digital currencies. El Salvador this week became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, and on Thursday, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a law that legalizes and regulates cryptocurrency. The move from SIX would make it one of the first major bourses to launch an exchange dedicated to digital assets. The group unveiled plans to debut a digital bourse in 2018. \"I can't afford to do an Uber, it doesn't work,\" Zeeb said in 2019, referring to the ride-hailing company's notoriety for launching in territories without first asking regulators for permission. SIX Digital Exchange said it would continue to invest in developing its technology over the coming months. The company added that it hopes to attract clients including banks, insurance firms and institutional investors, and aims to launch its exchange network globally. In a statement Friday, Zeeb said: \"This is an important milestone in bringing the digitalization of capital markets into the mainstream, but it is only the beginning. We will continue to work with our clients, regulators, and other stakeholders to shape the markets of the future.\""

        "detailedArticleContent": "A little-known cryptocurrency has only been around for a year and a half, and it's already a top 10 coin. Here's what you need to know about its meteoric rise. Solana is on a tear. The token hit an all-time high above $210 Thursday morning, according to CoinGecko data, making it the sixth-biggest digital currency with a market value of more than $60 billion. It was last trading at a price of $211.68, and is up a whopping 300% in the last month alone. Solana was worth just $1.50 at the start of the year. What is solana? Solana isn't a very well-known cryptocurrency. But it's gotten a lot of buzz lately, with the likes of Andreessen Horowitz investing more than $300 million in the start-up that created it in a June token sale. Other investors in the cryptocurrency platform include Polychain Capital, a venture capital firm founded by former Coinbase employee Olaf Carlson-Wee, and Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm led by well-known crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried. Solana is one of many digital currencies that's vying to take on ethereum, the world's second-biggest coin. 'Ethereum killers' Ethereum's technological underpinnings are similar to that of bitcoin . However, a key difference between the two is that developers can build applications on top of ethereum's network. That has resulted in an entire industry being built around the Ethereum blockchain, known as decentralized finance, or DeFi. NFTs, a buzzy type of token designed to represent ownership in a rare digital item, is one of many applications being fueled by Ethereum. However, other blockchains are emerging. Cardano, for example, promises to be a faster, more efficient alternative to Ethereum. The platform is gearing up for a major update this month that backers say will allow it to compete more effectively with Ethereum. This has helped propel Cardano's ada token to third-place in the rankings of the top digital currencies by market value. What's solana's pitch? A criticism of Ethereum is that it isn't scalable, so when there are huge spikes in traffic, the network struggles. The Solana platform promises to be much faster and cheaper than Ethereum. It claims to support over 1,000 transactions per second, with an average transaction fee of $0.00025. \"Ethereum has relished the lion's share of the market in recent years but the fact is that it just isn't scalable,\" George Harrap, co-founder of Step Finance, a dashboard for Solana transactions, told CNBC. \"It's far too expensive \u2014 it costs $100 to swap on Ethereum \u2014 and the fees are so unpredictable. Those new to crypto just don't want to spend that kind of money on something they will realistically know little about.\" Why is it rallying? Investors and analysts say it's down in large part to frenzied activity in the speculative NFT market. While many NFTs are built on Ethereum, Solana and other platforms are playing an increasingly large role. \"Many people believe that the Solana protocol is best positioned to support the needs of the NFT market,\" Scott Freeman, co-founder of digital asset management firm JST Capital, told CNBC. \"Thus, many view sol as an investment in the building blocks of NFTs.\" James Butterfill, investment strategist at crypto investment firm Coinshares, said institutional investors are starting to take notice of solana. \"Studying the investor fund flow data has highlighted Solana total assets under management has grown from US$15m to US$44m over the last week with inflows last week totalling US$13m,\" Butterfill told CNBC. \"This indicates it has been popular in investment funds as well as retail investors.\" What are the risks? Still, solana's wild rise has stunned some crypto industry figures. \"Solana's ascent has been meteoric, even by crypto standards,\" Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital currency lending firm Nexo, told CNBC. A key risk with any cryptocurrency is price volatility. Bitcoin, the first and largest digital coin, went from a record high above $60,000 in April to less than $30,000 in June. It has since recovered above $45,000. Meanwhile, regulators appear to be getting tougher on the DeFi space. The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly launched an investigation into Uniswap, the biggest decentralized crypto exchange.

The problem? It wasn't authentic. A web page added to Banksy's website Tuesday showed an image with an avatar resembling one of the many popular NFT collectibles known as CryptoPunks. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique crypto tokens that are designed to represent ownership of a rare digital item, like art or sports memorabilia. Sales of such digital assets have surged to record highs this year thanks to rising interest in both cryptocurrencies and collectible items. You can think of an NFT as a digital receipt of ownership. Buyers of the tokens effectively hold a certificate of authenticity to say they own the original item \u2014 but that doesn't grant them copyright, and the media can still be viewed for free by other internet users. Anyone who clicked on the Banksy NFT web page Tuesday would be directed to a link for an auction for a collectible called \"Great Redistribution of the Climate Change Disaster.\" The page was added to Banksy's site Tuesday morning and later deleted, stoking speculation that the site may have been hacked.

Scammers exploit NFTs Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at internet security firm ESET, said NFTs were still in their \"infant stage,\" meaning they're \"guaranteed to attract\" cybercriminals and scammers. \"Purchasing from verified locations is vital, but unfortunately this advice is flawed as soon as the authentic website is hacked,\" Moore told CNBC. \"Potential buyers should remain largely skeptical of NFTs while they are in these early stages, as they can be easily exploited, and always err on the side of caution.\" \"Scammers are very good at manipulating people, and the makeup of NFTs lends itself to being abused even more due to the lack of a physical product or service,\" Moore added."

The cryptocurrency traded at roughly $49,400 by the afternoon session, still shy of its all-time high above $64,000 set in April. The space has seen a boost in the past week on increasing adoption. PayPal said Monday it would open its platform in the U.K. to crypto buying and selling, and Coinbase said last week that it would buy $500 million in cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, is a bitcoin bull but remains wary of jumping in right here. \"I think it needs to be in your portfolio, but is $50,000 the place to be buying it? I wouldn't chase it,\" Baruch told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Monday. Bitcoin fell below $30,000 during a summer sell-off. Weakness in recent months was largely tied to a regulatory crackdown in China wherein some mining operations were forced to close. Since a June low of $28,600, it has rallied 73%. In a separate email to CNBC, Baruch said he owns bitcoin but began to trim his holdings once it bounced back to $45,000 \u2014 roughly the same level as its 200-day moving average and a 50% retracement level measured from its April peak and its June low. He said that level could prove a good entry point if bitcoin falls back to it. \"Again, I think it's a great space to be in, but don't chase it just because you see $50,000 in the headlines. Pick your spots and stick to your game plan,\" he said. Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, said there are more ways to play the bitcoin bounce than just through the asset itself. \"If you put your long-term investment hat on, there are two ways to look at this space \u2014 one is cryptocurrency the asset class and then the second one is an investment in the blockchain. For our team specifically, from a long-term theme perspective, we think that blockchain has a lot of value to it,\" Petrides said during the same interview.

It has risen 105% this year. \"As the world moves to more non-fungible tokens, NFTs, as we see more big players like PayPal and Visa and others start moving and converging in this space, we think that's going to lead to more activity on the blockchain, and ethereum is the largest open source blockchain out there,\" Petrides said.

The payments processor said Monday it bought a \"CryptoPunk,\" one of thousands of NFT-based digital avatars, for nearly $150,000 in ethereum. An NFT \u2014 which stands for non-fungible token \u2014 is a unique digital asset designed to represent ownership of a virtual item. Unlike bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, NFTs can't be exchanged like-for-like with another NFTs. Proponents say this makes NFTs scarce, driving up their value. NFTs have often been compared to physical collectible items like rare trading cards and works of art. CryptoPunks \u2014 one of the most popular non-fungible tokens \u2014 displayed in Times Square on May 12, 2021. Alexi Rosenfeld | Getty Images \"We think NFTs will play an important role in the future of retail, social media, entertainment, and commerce,\" Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in a blogpost Monday. \"To help our clients and partners participate, we need a firsthand understanding of the infrastructure requirements for a global brand to purchase, store, and leverage an NFT.\" Sheffield said CryptoPunks have become a \"cultural icon for the crypto community.\" \"With our CryptoPunk purchase, we're jumping in feet first,\" he said. \"This is just the beginning of our work in this space.\" Anchorage, a federally-chartered digital asset bank, facilitated the purchase, Visa said. Big firms join NFT craze Several big firms have been experimenting with NFTs lately. Christie's has auctioned off several NFTs, some worth millions of dollars. The auction house set records in March when an image created by the digital artist Beeple sold for $69 million. Meanwhile, a number of media publications, including CNN, The New York Times and Fortune magazine, have sold NFTs of their own. But some critics are skeptical of NFTs. While such tokens represent a digital certificate of ownership, buyers don't own the underlying item, and internet users can still view the associated media online. Some people have even stolen other artists' work and gone on to sell them as NFTs. \"The purchaser of Beeple's $69 million NFT artwork, 'Everydays \u2013 The First 5000 Days', owns the unique token,\" Adam Rendle, partner at law firm Taylor Wessing, said in a blogpost. \"They do not, however, own copyright or any other intellectual property rights in the digital artwork itself. They cannot distribute or otherwise commercialise the represented asset.\""

Zhaojun was \"taken away\" by Chinese police on May 21 with his computers, phones, hardware wallets and mnemonic phrases all confiscated, Multichain said. His sister was taken into custody on Thursday, it said. The team has had no contact with Zhaojun and has maintained day-to-day operations relying on existing access to servers that had not been revoked and with assistance from Zhaojun's sister, who transferred the remaining user assets in the router pool as a \"preservation action.\" With the sister now out of contact, the \"status of the assets she has preserved is uncertain,\" Multichain said. The protocol's precarious existence was highlighted last week when it was exploited for $130 million after an attacker drained funds from numerous token bridges. \"According to Zhaojun's sister, login information from an IP address in Kunming was found on the cloud server platform, along with a series of operations transferring funds from the MPC addresses,\" Multichain said in the Twitter thread. Multichain's MULTI token is down nearly 12% on the day at the time of writing, after sinking from around $2.28 to $2.01 following the announcement. "

        "detailedArticleContent": "A day after setting off a frenzy of Twitter speculation by tweeting out an orange dot, the crypto arm of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has revealed its blockchain infrastructure plans: Magi, a rollup client for Optimism. Magi is still in development and months away from being a production-ready offering, according to an announcement posted by crypto engineer Noah Citron. The project is a new client for OP Stack, the standardized, open-source development stack that powers Optimism. The system is written using the Rust programming language and is meant to serve as a faster alternative to op-node, the only existing rollup client that\u2019s maintained by OP Labs and written in the Go programming language. A16z\u2019s thesis is that more systems make for more robust decentralization for Optimism, and the addition of one based on Rust will attract more developers. A client is broadly any type of software application that can allow a user to interact with a blockchain. \u201CMagi acts as the consensus client (often called a rollup client in the context of the OP Stack) in the traditional execution\/consensus split of Ethereum,\" wrote Citron in the post. \"It feeds new blocks to the execution client in order to advance the chain,\" he continued. \"Magi performs the same core functionality as the reference implementation (op-node) and works alongside an execution node (such as op-geth) to sync to any OP Stack chain, including Optimism and Base.\" On Tuesday, Citron tweeted out an orange dot with \u201Ccoming soon,\u201D which Twitter users tied to Coinbase\u2019s similar tweet of a blue dot ahead of its Optimism-based layer 2 announcement. A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin responded, saying his firm wasn\u2019t working on a layer 2 blockchain."

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Sui Foundation, an organization dedicated to layer 1 blockchain Sui, has appointed a managing director to shepherd the ecosystem\u2019s growth following a protracted market downturn punctuated by regulatory crackdowns. Greg Siourounis, an economics professor at Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences in Athens, Greece, and formerly with Barclays Capital, takes the newly created position immediately. The appointment forms part of the year-old blockchain\u2019s efforts to bolster activity across the network by promoting the development of decentralized applications and expanding the user base. It\u2019s a goal that will require Sui to foster an inclusive community that brings many different types of people into the fold, Siourounis told CoinDesk. \u201COur aim as a foundation is to increase awareness about the blockchain, not only with the developers community \u2026 but also with the rest of the world, which is entrepreneurs, startups, corporates, governments,\u201D Siourounis said. The Sui Foundation will continue to fund grants to the network\u2019s builders and support initiatives to educate the community on the technology underpinning its network, he said. The foundation currently funds developer grants ranging between $10,000 and $100,000 in addition to distributing its native SUI token as supplements to those awards. The Sui Foundation will also promote research into blockchain technologies, knowledge of which remains limited. It\u2019s a move that will foster more compassion and collaboration within and beyond the decentralized finance world as regulators continue to crack down on the digital asset industry, Siourounis said. \u201CThe main issue we have is that there's not enough knowledge about blockchain technology and what it can bring to our community and the world, and how this can help actually change the everyday life of everyone out there,\u201D Siourounis said. Mysten Labs-backed Sui, the brainchild of ex-Meta Platforms engineers, launched early last year as a high throughput, low latency and inexpensive platform to execute smart contracts and power applications. The blockchain is in the process of launching an initial coin offering for its native token SUI."

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Ethereum blockchain remains the dominant operating system for decentralized finance, or DeFi, because few alternatives existed until recently, Bank of America said in a research report Tuesday. The bank, however, said it expects Ethereum adoption and usage to decelerate if the blockchain is not able to increase its \"throughput,\" adding that application developers will probably choose other networks to build on. In crypto, throughput refers to the number of transactions a blockchain can complete per second. \u201CWe view Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability as dependent on its ability to fulfill the vision laid out in its road map, which includes implementing sharding architecture to expand its throughput capacity significantly,\u201D analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote. Bank of America noted that Ethereum\u2019s smart contract-enabled platform gave it a first-mover advantage as app developers gravitated to the platform, which led to network effects as the number of decentralized apps (dapps) and users grew. That early success, however, was a \u201Cdouble-edged sword\u201D as the large number of transactions resulted in network congestion and surging transaction fees, the note said. A dapp is an application that uses blockchain technology to keep users' data out of the hands of the organizations behind it. Smart contracts are computerized blockchain protocols that execute terms of a contract. \u201CAs in prior tech cycles (PCs, software, internet), new projects are likely to emerge and poorly positioned projects will exit,\u201D the note added."

Near development stagnated in 2022 compared with the year before despite its focus on usability, its innovative architecture and its ecosystem of more than a thousand applications, the bank noted. Transactions fees have fallen since the first quarter of last year, and the rate of new users has dropped since the second quarter, which suggests that its \u201Capplications are no longer driving accelerating user growth,\u201D Bank of America said.

Coinbase says given the ecosystem\u2019s relative strength in terms of network activity with regards to transactions, users and development, Solana is well positioned to reassert itself as a genuine layer 1 competitor. A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure, of a blockchain. Activity on Solana compares favorably to that on Ethereum at present, suggesting the solana (SOL) token may be undervalued relative to ether (ETH), the note said. Furthermore, solana\u2019s market capitalization is only about 4.3% of ether\u2019s, while the amount of daily active users on the blockchain represents around 43.7% of Ethereum\u2019s daily active user base.

        "creationDate": "2022-02-24",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A team with intimate knowledge of the Facebook-initiated Libra stablecoin project announced plans to bring the network into the wild \u2013 albeit under a different name and seemingly with a different focus. Fresh on the heels of the Diem Association\u2019s confirmed winddown, a new team called Aptos said in a blog post on Thursday that it was taking another shot at bringing the ill-fated Diem blockchain to life. According to two sources speaking on the condition of anonymity, Aptos is raising $200 million at a $2 billion valuation to do so. The people with knowledge of the deal said Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and several other crypto venture capital firms were involved. Should Aptos find its footing, it would be a stunning reversal for Diem \u2013 a project that was much ballyhooed in 2019 but was fatally crippled by regulatory blowback in the subsequent two and a half years. Notably, the blog post makes no mention of the proposed stablecoins that riled lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad. \u201CWe are not starting from scratch,\u201D Aptos wrote in its \u201Cgenesis\u201D blog post, describing plans to launch the \u201Csafest and most production-ready blockchain in the world.\u201D \u201CWe are the original creators, researchers, designers and builders of Diem, the blockchain that was first built to serve this purpose,\u201D they added. \u201CWhile the world never got to see what we built, our work is far from over.\u201D The post doesn\u2019t mention the team\u2019s fundraising efforts. One source with knowledge of the project said the Aptos team was building its new layer 1 blockchain based on the original Libra white paper. The pitch to prospective investors was \u201CLibra without Facebook,\u201D the source said. Unlike with Libra, however, the initial focus won\u2019t be on cross-border payments but on non-fungible tokens, they added. General-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Flow and now Aptos are built to support multiple applications. Aptos is being led by Avery Ching and Mo Shaikh, according to the Thursday blog post. Ching previously worked at Meta\u2019s Novi crypto subsidiary and is credited with co-creating the Diem blockchain\u2019s DiemBFT consensus protocol. Shaikh is also formerly of Novi, but previously spent nearly three years as a director of strategy at ConsenSys, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Ethereum venture studio. Much of the work undertaken by Diem-affiliated teams \u2013 be it by Calibra (now Novi) or the Libra Association (now Diem Association) \u2013 was placed under open-source licenses, and so the intellectual property can be used as the foundation of a new company. The team applied for the Aptos Blockchain trademark last week, according to public records. According to the blog post, Aptos believes new leadership can finally get Diem\u2019s technology over the finish line. \u201CSince departing Meta (formerly Facebook) we have been able to put our ideas into motion, ditch bureaucratic red tape and build an entirely new network from the ground up that brings them to fruition,\u201D they wrote."

        "articleSummary": "Tokens of the layer 1 blockchains were up as much as 25% while the broader market took a beating.",
        "creationDate": "2022-01-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Tokens of Near (NEAR) and Cosmos (ATOM) were among the only gainers among major cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours as the broader market extended its slide. Prices of Near and Cosmos have almost doubled in the past month amid increased interest in layer 1 blockchains. Layer 1 refers to blockchain platforms such as Ethereum or Avalanche over which developers can deploy applications or services. NEAR posted gains of as much as 25% from Monday\u2019s lows to trade at over $16.62 in afternoon Asian hours on Tuesday before dropping back. Prices are down 6% from last week\u2019s highs of $17.67, having breached the resistance level around $17. A support level exists at the $13 mark, and if NEAR drops through that, the token could slump to as low as $10. The protocol gained favor among investors as a layer 1 play and was the third-largest crypto ecosystem by developer activity, a report from crypto venture firm Electric Capital said last week. ATOM added as much as 8% to over $39.33 in the past 24 hours before a brief sell-off saw it lose 35 cents at the time of writing. Prices were as low as $32 on Monday evening. The tokens are trading around a resistance-turned-support level of $37 at the time of writing, with a prominent buying zone until the $30 level if historic price action is considered. Crypto developers say newer blockchains create avenues for the development of new protocols, which contribute to their appeal among investors. \u201CIf Cosmos becomes EVM compatible it\u2019s great news for the DeFi space because companies will be able to extend the reach of their dapps [decentralized applications] to a new network and develop new ones on top of it too,\u201D Asaf Naim, co-founder of crypto management app Kirobo, said in a Telegram message with CoinDesk. EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine, the part of Ethereum that executes the blockchain\u2019s rules and makes sure a submitted transaction or smart contract follows them. Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche, Terra and Solana surged to highs in 2021 \u2013 posting yearly returns of as high as 3,800% to token investors \u2013 as users moved away from Ethereum to cheaper and faster blockchains. Capital has since rotated to previously lesser-known blockchains, such as Fantom, Harmony, Near and Cosmos. Fantom emerged as one of the top performers in the last week of December, posting returns of as high as 77% in a little over 14 days. But some, like Naim, say Ethereum remains the top dog: \u201CIt\u2019s great to see Ethereum competitors doing well because it widens the ecosystem, but I\u2019d also say that the fact that we measure their characteristics in terms of Ethereum shows the extent to which Ethereum is still the gold standard in the industry,\u201D he said."

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Graph has introduced Scalar, a microtransaction system meant to enable new ways for the platform\u2019s node operators and data providers to make money. The Graph, which describes itself as \u201Cthe indexing and query layer of the decentralized web,\u201D functions as a link between decentralized applications (dapps) and different blockchains, providing a data querying platform that other blockchains and projects can use for their data requirements. The platform enables participants to package queries into \u201Csubgraphs,\u201D custom feeds that provide application programming interface (API) data for use by blockchains and dapps. The platform supports decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, including Uniswap, Synthetix and Aave, as well as major blockchains Polkadot, Solana, NEAR and CELO. The project also has its own native token, GRT. \u201CUsing Scalar, node operators have a new way to monetize their infrastructure through query fees paid in GRT, and data providers can be paid directly for making useful data available for apps without paywalls and ads,\u201D The Graph Foundation said in a statement, noting that the volume of transactions on the network created the need for a microtransactions infrastructure beyond existing options. \u201CThe major jump in Web3 use cases\u201D including DeFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) \u201Chas created unprecedented demand for a truly decentralized and scalable query processing system,\u201D the foundation said. Scalar was co-developed by The Graph Foundation and software developer Edge & Node with Connext, a peer-to-peer, cross-chain liquidity network specializing in microtransactions. Using state channels, where users can interact directly with one another more efficiently outside of the blockchain, Scalar aggregates and compresses transactions before they are finalized on-chain. \u201CWithin The Graph ecosystem, we started looking at state channels a little over two years ago. And everyone said we were crazy,\u201D Tegan Kline, co-founder and business lead at Edge & Node, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201CWe kind of went against that, and we did a lot of research within the state channels space.\u201D \u201CThis is the first time state channels will be used in broad-scale production,\u201D Kline added. \u201CScalar is this major new building block for infrastructure in the decentralized applications space. We\u2019ll be using this within The Graph ecosystem to be able to handle the billions of queries that we\u2019ve seen on The Graph\u2019s hosted service, in The Graph\u2019s decentralized network.\u201D In March, The Graph\u2019s hosted service processed more than 600 million queries a day alone, totaling more than 19 billion queries, according to the platform. Kline noted that the platform has seen \u201Cover 100x growth in the hosted service. In June of last year, we did 1 billion queries, which was a really big milestone.\u201D The March queries figure \u201Cspeaks to the explosive growth within Ethereum and the other blockchains that are supported on the hosted service,\u201D she said."

        "articleSummary": "EOS, Tezos and XRP have not seen high levels of intended use, according to a new report from researchers in London.",
        "creationDate": "2020-06-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The problem with paying gas to run transactions is that it discourages lots of transactions. The advantage of paying gas to run transactions, though, is that it discourages lots of transactions. This contradiction is captured well in a new paper examining transactions on EOS, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL) over a seven-month period ending in April. Researchers from Imperial College London and University College London found the overwhelming number of transactions on these three networks either have no value attached or are passing it back and forth within one entity. Titled \"Revisiting Transactional Statistics of High-scalability Blockchain,\" by Daniel Perez, Jiahua Xu and Benjamin Livshits, the report explains these findings in detail. \"Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes,\" the authors write. \"In particular, 96% of the transactions on EOSIO were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless token; on Tezos, 76% of throughput was used for maintaining consensus; and over 94% of transactions on XRPL carried no economic value.\" The authors' latest version came out Wednesday, following up on two prior versions, with this one including several more months of data. It immediately sparked discussion, with its findings that high-throughput blockchains don't necessarily have a lot of payment activity. It also illuminated the fact that transparency doesn't necessarily equal legibility. So many records can pile up on a blockchain that needed information can become needles in a very large haystack. As Perez, a Ph.D. candidate at Imperial College London told CoinDesk in an email, \"When the level of spam activity is very high, the size of the history gets disproportionately large given the amount of useful activity on the network. This makes such blockchains much more difficult to analyze and reason about.\" That said, the authors' analysis is based on a careful examination of each blockchain, looking at the kinds of transactions and characterizing what kind of work they represented. Then they looked at the biggest users of the networks, which generally corresponded to most of the usage, and dug deeper into what was going on in their transactions. As the authors note, there has been a dearth of academic investigation into blockchains besides that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This analysis of EOS, XRP Ledger and Tezos covers the period from October 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, using data collected by the open source tool, Blockchain Analyzer. Here's what they found for each chain. Last November, CoinDesk reported on a mysterious airdrop on EOS that gave users an incentive to make as many low-value transactions as they could, called EIDOS, which overall made the blockchain more expensive to use, making it look very much like a denial of service (DoS) attack (also evidenced by the fact that \"DOS\" is part of the airdrop's name). The researchers found that most of the transactions taking place on EOS, at least through the end of April, were related to the EIDOS stunt. The authors write, \"Before the arrival of the EIDOS token, approximately 50% of these are transactions to betting games. ... The launch of EIDOS increased the total number of transactions more than tenfold, resulting in 96% of the transactions being used for token transfers.\" To recap: The EIDOS smart contract sends a token to any EOS wallet address that sends it any amount of EOS. The smart contract instantly returns any EOS sent along with the token. The smart contract rewards transactions, not value, so it doesn't matter how much EOS gets sent. It sends the same number of tokens back no matter what. EIDOS was worth a little less than $0.02 when we last reported it on it. It currently trades for about $0.0008, according to CoinGecko. Additionally, the authors also found that most of the transactions on one of EOS's large apps, WhaleEx, look suspicious. The WhaleEx website says it is the \"#1 Decentralized Exchange in the World,\" yet the authors looked at its transactions and found: WhaleEx could not be immediately reached for comment. Block.One, the creators of the EOSIO software that runs EOS among a few other blockchains, declined to comment directly to CoinDesk. Instead, they directed CoinDesk to a new Medium post by CTO Dan Larimer, which does not directly address the questions about EIDOS and WhaleEx, but instead dwells on how the report's authors define throughput. Larimer writes: Again, Block.One declined to further comment. XRP is periodically beset by spam. The authors write: \"The ledger experienced two waves of abnormally high traffic in the form of Payment transactions in late 2019, the first between the end of October and the beginning of November, the second \u2013 at a higher level \u2013 between the end of November and the beginning of December.\" Why such traffic occurs, however, is unclear. \"It remains something of a mystery how such an expensive form of 'spam' benefited its originators.\" Ripple's CTO David Schwartz addressed this point when a prior draft of this paper was under discussion. He wrote in May: That said, they also found that most XRP holders do very little. \"The distribution of the number of transactions per account is highly skewed. Over one third (71 thousand) of the accounts have transacted only once during the entire observation period, whereas the 35 most active accounts are responsible for half of the total traffic,\" they wrote, though such Pareto distributions are not unusual, especially when money is concerned. Ripple has not yet provided further comment to CoinDesk on this latest draft. On Tezos, the authors find that most activity on the network is related to governance and staking. They write, \"Tezos has a high number of 'endorsements,' which are used as part of the consensus protocol, and only a small fraction of the throughput are actual transactions.\" Further, a large portion of the transactions appear to be bakers (the validators) making payments to users who have delegated XTZ.\" Later, the paper notes: It does not, however, find suspicious or malicious transactions in any real volume on Tezos. TQuorum, an entity that promotes Tezos, had not yet provided comment as of press time. As most people who follow cryptocurrency know, the Bitcoin blockchain debuted what's come to be known as the internet of value. The paper's analysis then is based on how frequently users actually transfer value, as opposed to making other kinds of transactions. It raises questions about whether it is wise to design a blockchain so that valueless transactions are free or nearly free. The authors write: In short, the authors write, \"The massive potential of those blockchains has thus far not been fully realized for their intended purposes.\""

        "detailedArticleContent": "When choosing a name for your crypto project, it's a really good idea to Google it first. The latest to have apparently fallen at that hurdle is a group of Steem community members who recently opted to form a new blockchain over fears that Tron founder Justin Tron would seek to exert too much control of Steem's ecosystem. The group, Hive.io, dubbed the new blockchain Hive, and it materialized via a hard fork of Steem last week. The plan is to reproduce all steem tokens with new hive tokens on a one-for-one basis. Sun's big pile of steems would not be copied over, leaving him with no power in the new chain's governance. However, in choosing the Hive moniker, the project has stepped on the corporate toes of a blockchain firm branded with the same name. HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd., a Canadian publicly listed mining firm based in Vancouver, published a notice Monday saying it has sent a cease-and-desist letter from its legal representatives to Hive.io, saying the new blockchain is tapping into its investment in building \"goodwill\" in the industry. \"In response to multiple shareholder inquiries understandably confused by this Blockchain\u2019s announcement, HIVE clarifies that it has no association with this Blockchain,\" the mining firm writes. \"HIVE believes this Blockchain\u2019s use of 'Hive' and 'Hive Blockchain' is, intentionally or otherwise, confusing with the Company\u2019s brand, which it has used globally over the Internet in relation to its connection with blockchain related goods and services including cryptocurrency.\" Frank Holmes, interim executive chairman at HIVE, said the firm has \"no issue with the proposed blockchain beyond its name.\" \"However, for legal reasons, we have no option but to seek to protect our interests, dispel the ongoing confusion and avoid any potential damage to our reputation,\" he said. \"We are hopeful this can be easily resolved with a name change. Any continued usage by the blockchain will only evidence an intentionally predatory, misleading and fraudulent strategy.\u201D CoinDesk reached out to Hive.io for comment but did not immediately receive an answer."

The Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange announced Saturday its proprietary network, Huobi Chain, had been successfully deployed on its testnet. Developed in collaboration with layer-1 protocol provider Nervos, Huobi said its new blockchain will allow businesses and regulators to determine the rules of the road for the emerging DeFi space. \"With Huobi Chain, we want to provide the decentralized framework that facilitates industry-wide collaboration, which is critical to the widespread adoption of DeFi,\" said Ciara Sun, Huobi vice president for global business. Entities in the financial services sector, including banks, will be able to use Huobi Chain to develop DeFi applications that have anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance baked into the chain itself, the exchange said. A Huobi spokesperson told CoinDesk the firm hasn't yet entered talks with banks or other financial institutions, although that's part of the plan once Huobi Chain has successfully passed the public beta phase. The technology would allow regulators to maintain oversight of the distributed ledger through Huobi Chain's delegated proof-of-consensus (DPOS) algorithm. A decentralized identification system (DID) allows users to create identity profiles that can be accepted and verified by regulators in multiple jurisdictions. The exchange is eyeing use cases for its tech across areas such as tokenized asset issuance, payments, identity verification and lending. Although Huobi Chain will support multiple cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the exchange's native Huobi Token will be the protocol's sole utility token. Support for other types of digital assets will be added over time, the exchange said. Huobi Chain's mainnet launch is expected to take place later this year."

        "creationDate": "2020-01-15",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Crypto startup Kadena\u2019s public blockchain launched Wednesday, adding interoperable smart contract support between the public chain and its private chain counterparts. The Brooklyn-based offshoot of JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain center announced the launch marks another step in its effort to develop scalable, secure proof-of-work alternatives to the current leading cryptocurrencies ethereum and bitcoin. As part of its efforts in interoperability, Kadena is also integrating its wallet Chainweaver with the Cosmos Network, allowing different blockchains to interact. The integration process is expected to be complete by March. Using Kadena, individuals or businesses can begin looking at apps and projects that use \u201Ca fully-scalable base layer as a piece of public infrastructure\u201D while maintaining privacy features to address any regulatory or other concerns, founder and president Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk. Using an in-house smart contract language called Pact, Kadena said the advancement introduces a \u201Chybrid blockchain\u201D model capable of processing 750 transactions per second, though 750 is just Kadena\u2019s conservative estimate. Popejoy, who previously directed JP Morgan's Blockchain Center of Excellence, said his protocol\u2019s braided blockchain design can accommodate even industrial use cases. According to Popejoy, the durability of ethereum and bitcoin proves PoW\u2019s value but their failures to reliably process transactions (bitcoin) or grow to the demands of decentralized apps (ethereum) makes them unsuitable for enterprise use cases. Public chains are also anathema to certain sensitive contexts such as medical privacy issues, he said. \u201CKadena\u2019s whole goal is to solve the scaling problems of bitcoin and the security problems of ethereum,\u201D Popejoy said. The hybrid model based on a PoW protocol hopes to take on this issue by essentially allowing users to switch between chains using the Pact programming language. \u201CYou have a scalable private blockchain, you have a scalable public blockchain and you have Pact, and the application layer that allows you to communicate between all three,\u201D Popejoy said. Kadena said a number of companies already plan to utilize its hybrid blockchain model in finance and healthcare, including Rymedi, a South Carolina medical technology firm and facilitator of an FDA-approved study of blockchain tracing specialty prescription drugs. To further aid its scaling and interoperability goals, Kadena hopes to conclude its Cosmos integration by the end of March. As part of the move, Kadena will make Pact available on Cosmos as Kadenamint, meaning developers will be able to create smart contracts using Kadena\u2019s token starting Wednesday. \u201CBesides storing cryptocurrencies, our multi-blockchain wallet can provide a tool kit and user-friendly programming environment for developers on the Cosmos Network,\u201D said Kadena founder Will Martino, another JPMorgan veteran, once lead engineer for the bank's blockchain prototype, Juno. Developers can write smart contracts for both Cosmos and Kadena from the same interface using Chainweaver. The wallet includes features such as Formal Verification and capabilities-based security, according to Martino. To fund its operations, Kadena raised $15 million in 2018 from investors including Multicoin Capital and the private investment arm of the owners of Fidelity Investments. The firm aims to raise another $20 million via a token sale. Ethan Buchman, technical director of the Interchain Foundation, one of Cosmos\u2019 largest backers, said in a statement that scalability, security and usability are all major issues to address. \"We're working with Kadena to integrate their digital wallet Chainweaver into the larger Cosmos ecosystem to tackle these issues like never before, enabling users to build Pact smart contracts running on the Tendermint consensus engine through Chainweaver's stellar UX,\" Buchman said."

        "detailedArticleContent": "With the long-awaited Libra white paper, Facebook is showing off its blockchain smarts, and making a bid for crypto credibility. Released Tuesday morning, the 29-page paper describes a protocol designed to evolve as it powers a new global currency. More than a year in the making, the document opens by trumpeting the new blockchain's ambitious goal: As a first step toward achieving the \"decentralized\" part, the protocol has been turned over to a new organization, the Libra Association, whose members will hold separate tokens allowing them on-chain voting rights to govern decisions about Libra. \"Over time, it\u2019s designed to transition the node membership from these founding members who have a stake in the creation of the ecosystem to people who hold Libra and have a stake in the ecosystem as a whole,\u201D Ben Maurer, Facebook's blockchain technical lead, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. In short, Libra is designed to be a high throughput, global blockchain, one that's built with programmable money in mind but limits how much users can do initially as it evolves from prototype to a robust ecosystem. Unlike many other blockchains, Libra seems laser-focused on payments and other financial use cases for consumers. But the white paper itself seems geared to demonstrate both Facebook's proposed advances to the science of distributed consensus and its appreciation for what has been built so far. Indeed, over the last several months, many sources told CoinDesk they had visited Facebook to share their perspective on decentralized technology. The company has done a lot of homework. And now it has created a new language for writing commands on its blockchain, called Move, and opened its software to public inspection. \"To validate the design of the Libra protocol, we have built an open-source prototype implementation \u2014 Libra Core \u2014 in anticipation of a global collaborative effort to advance this new ecosystem,\" the white paper states. \u201CIt\u2019d be sort of presumptuous for us to say we\u2019re creating an open environment and then say, \u2018Well, but we\u2019ve set everything in stone,\u2019\u201D Maurer told CoinDesk. \u201CIt\u2019s a paper that requests feedback.\u201D Libra's designers have picked what they see as the best features of existing blockchains while providing their own updates and refinements. 1. Like bitcoin, there's no real identity on the blockchain. From the perspective of the blockchain itself, you don't exist. Only public-private key pairs exist. The white paper states: \"The Libra protocol does not link accounts to a real-world identity. A user is free to create multiple accounts by generating multiple key-pairs. Accounts controlled by the same user have no inherent link to each other.\" 2. Like Hyperledger, it's permissioned (at least to start). Initially, the consensus structure for Libra will be dozens of organizations that will run nodes on the network, validating transactions. Each time consensus is voted on for a new set of transactions, a leader will be designated at random to count up the votes. Libra opts to rely on familiarity rather than democracy to choose the right entities to establish consensus in the early days. \"Founding Members are organizations with established reputations, making it unlikely that they would act maliciously,\" the white paper states. These are entities range from traditional payment networks (Mastercard, Visa) to internet and gig-economy giants (eBay, Lyft) to blockchain natives (Xapo) to VCs (Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital). 3. Like tezos, it comes with on-chain governance. The only entities that can vote at the outset are Founding Members. These members hold Libra Investment Tokens that give them voting rights on the network, where they can make decisions about managing the reserve and letting new validators join the network. The governance structure is built into the Move software from the start, and like Tezos it is subject to revision over time. Updates will be essential as it adds members and evolves from what's more like a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system (such as EOS or steem) to a fully decentralized proof-of-stake ecosystem. 4. Like ethereum, it makes currency programmable. In a number of ways, the white paper defines interesting ways in which its users can interact with the core software and data structure. For example, anyone can make a non-voting replica of the blockchain or run various read commands associated with objects (such as smart contracts or a set of wallets) defined on Libra. Crucially, Libra's designers seem to agree with ethereum's that running code should have a cost, so all operations require payment of Libra as gas in order to run. Unlike ethereum, Libra makes two important changes in its smart contracts. First, it limits how much users can do on the protocol at first (the full breadth of Move's features are not yet open). Second, it breaks data out from software, so one smart contract (what Move refers to as a \"module\") can be directed at any pool of assets, which Move calls \"resources.\" So one set of code can be used on any number of wallets or collections of assets. 5. Also like ethereum, it thinks proof-of-stake is the future, but it is also not ready yet. \"Over time, membership eligibility will shift to become completely open and based only on the member\u2019s holdings of Libra,\" the white paper promises, describing a path to real permissionless-ness. Meanwhile, the paper dismisses the approach of the blockchains with the longest track record (namely bitcoin), stating, \"We did not consider proof-of-work based protocols due to their poor performance and high energy (and environmental) costs.\" 6. Like Binance's coin, it does a lot of burning. Blockchains that build in purposeful burning of tokens became very influential last year. Binance, the world's leading exchange, created the BNB token, with which users could pay trading fees at a discount. Binance led the way to token bonfires, regularly burning a significant portion of its profits paid in BNB. Libra won't use burning to enhance the value of its coin. Rather (as with collateralized stablecoins such as tether), tokens will be issued and burned constantly, as the association responds to demand shifts for its reserve, with no supply maximum or minimum supply. 7. Like coda, users don't need to hold onto the whole transaction history. A lesser-known protocol, Coda, was one of the first to make its ledger disposable. Users only need to hold a proof of the last block, which they can easily check on a smartphone to be sure they are interacting with a valid ledger. Similarly, on Libra, \"historical data may grow beyond the amount that can be handled by an individual server. Validators are free to discard historical data not needed to process new transactions.\" 8. Like EOS, it hasn't worked everything out yet. EOS launched without its approach to governance well defined, which yielded complications down the road. Similarly, Libra promises to decentralize, but there's nothing that inherently forces its members to do so. Other matters are left undecided as well. For example, the storage of data. \"We anticipate that as the system is used, eventually storage growth associated with accounts may become a problem,\" the white paper says. The document anticipates but does not define a system of rent for data storage. It cites a number of examples of other open questions, such as how best to maintain security as more validators join the network, how often the pool of validators can change and how modules can be updated safely. As the paper admits: The Libra white paper is signed by 53 people. Though senior Facebook executives such as CEO Mark Zuckerberg and blockchain lead David Marcus are notably absent from the author list, the team that wrote the document looks to be one of the most-heavy hitting in blockchain history. The signatories hail from nearly every continent and include Ph.D. students from Stanford, computer science professors, and artificial intelligence (AI) developers. They include:"

        "creationDate": "2018-10-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Another do-it-yourself build-a-blockchain tool is about to launch. Speaking at the Web3 Summit in Berlin on Tuesday, ethereum co-founder and Parity Technologies founder Gavin Wood announced that his company's new tool, Substrate, is weeks from release. As the technical underpinning for his interoperability protocol Polkadot, Substrate provides a generalized platform for blockchain development. According to Wood, who spoke to CoinDesk before the announcement, Substrate will help Polkadot reach its \"main bet\" \u2013 as a simple mechanism to allow people to build and launch their own blockchains. He told CoinDesk: Describing Substrate in more detail, Wood said that it provides an entirely general purpose platform for blockchain development. \"Substrate is much more general than ethereum,\" Wood said, adding: \"We really wanted to make something pure and general.\" Earlier this month, the Parity Technologies team announced it had used the Substrate codebase to deploy \"Shasper\" \u2013 the latest iteration of ethereum's scaling roadmap, that mixes scaling solution sharding with consensus switch, proof-of-stake. While Substrate is already actionable, Wood emphasized that work remains to be done prior to its public release, specifically as relates to developer documentation, as well as \"rounding some corners and removing any sharp edges.\" \"I'm giving it a three week countdown or something on these lines,\" Wood said. At the conference, Wood also announced that the Substrate software will be relicensed to Apache 2, a more permissive, business-friendly license than the current GPL3. According to the Wood, the new license, \"instantly opens the door to all of the Fortune 500 to actually experiment with it.\" On top of that, Wood also presented a new Polkadot design that, in his words, allows for \"infinite scalability.\" This entails a tree-type structure of Polkadot chains running on Polkadot chains, something \"cyclical and self-referential, what mathematicians call composability,\" he said. Wood continued, \"[It's] a hierarchy of chains and the reason that it's possible is that Polkadot can host itself, and every time you go down a level you can scale up 100 times.\" Together with Polkadot \u2013 that is targeted for release in Q3 2019 \u2013 Wood said today's Substrate release paves the way for blockchain networks of all kinds to coexist. He told CoinDesk: It could seem a bit complicated, and sure enough, much of Wood's presentation hinged on clarifying the distinction between Polkadot and Substrate. Speaking to Substrate specifically, Wood emphasized that it was different from ethereum in its upgradeability. Unlike on ethereum, protocol changes with Substrate do not require a system-wide upgrade, or a hard fork, to be activated. This will likely be attractive to many since as Wood put it, hard forks can be a \"nightmare.\" Because getting all the different stakeholders on board with new changes has proved difficult for many blockchain projects in the past, Wood contended that the long-term debates this arouses makes blockchains less able to keep up with technological developments. \"Substrate-based chains can upgrade themselves, and this ability to change is useful for fixing hiccups along the way,\" he told CoinDesk. This works through token holders casting votes on code changes, Wood said. And in this way, Substrate and Polkadot make power structures within networks clear and transparent \u2013 distinct from the informal governance that is the basis of most cryptocurrencies today, he argued. Wood concluded:"

        "creationDate": "2018-10-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Ground X, the blockchain development arm of the South Korean messaging giant Kakao, has launched a test network (testnet) of its proprietary blockchain network dubbed Klaytn. The firm said in a press release on Monday that the testnet is now made available to 10 invited partners on the network. It has also published a white paper offering details of the platform, which seeks to lay the technological foundation for decentralized applications or dapps. According to the white paper, the Klaytn blockchain takes a hybrid approach that adopts the concepts of consensus nodes (CNs) and ranger nodes (RNs) to achieve both scalability and transparency. CNs are invited partners on the network that together form a private blockchain to batch and confirm transactions by running a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm, according to the white paper. Meanwhile, anyone from the public can connect to the network and participate as a RN, whose duty is to double check blocks that have been propagated by the CNs. \"Ranger nodes (RNs) download newly created blocks from the CNs and periodically communicate ('gossip') among themselves while storing a local copy of the blockchain. They validate the new blocks chosen by the CNs and check that the CNs never equivocate on the content of a given block height. Anybody can join the network as an RN,\" Ground X wrote in the paper. Via this hybrid approach, Ground X claims the block propagation interval in the testnet has been reduced to less than one per second and offers throughput of up to 1,500 transactions per second. To incentivize participation, the network will proportionally distribute 10 billion \"KLAY \" tokens to both types of nodes based on their contribution, though an exact ratio has not been announced so far. The network is expected to issue additional tokens every year as block rewards. Ground X added that it will publish the network's source code to the public at a later stage and the Klaytn full live network (or mainnet) will launch in the first quarter of 2019. At press time, the company had not responded to a CoinDesk enquiry on whether the KLAY token will be tradable on exchages when the network is official live. The testnet launch comes roughly six months after Kakao revealed its plan to move into the blockchain space. As CoinDesk previously reported, the firm confirmed the creation of Ground X in March and said at the time that the envisioned blockchain network will also be integrated with Kakao's existing internet offerings such as Kakao Talk messaging app.  "

        "creationDate": "2018-09-26",
        "detailedArticleContent": "An Australian federal science agency has completed a global test on a blockchain network it developed with the University of Sydney, which, the two said, indicated the system can process 30,000 cross-border transactions per second. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) released the test results in an announcement on Wednesday, which was deployed using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) global cloud infrastructure. Called Red Belly Blockchain and created by CSIRO's technology arm Data61 and the Concurrent Systems Research Group (CSRG) from the University of Sydney, the network was tested across 1,000 nodes in 14 countries in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. CSIRO claimed \"the benchmark was set by sending 30,000 transactions per second from different geographic regions\" with an average latency of three seconds, adding it was the agency's first blockchain test in a global setting. The goal of the network is to solve the common issue of scalability among major blockchains currently by using an alternative consensus algorithm instead of the proof-of-work mechanism adopted by public networks such as bitcoin. According to a paper published by the CSIRO and the University of Sydney, the group has turned to a different algorithm called deterministic byzantine consensus. The idea, based on the paper's description, is to allow the network to complete transactions after receiving a threshold of messages instead of having to wait for confirmations from nodes that are slow. \"Real-world applications of blockchain have been struggling to get off the ground due to issues with energy consumption and complexities induced by the proof of work,\" said Dr. Vincent Gramoli, a senior researcher at Data61 and head of the CSRG, in the announcement, adding: \"The deployment of Red Belly Blockchain on AWS shows the unique scalability and strength of the next generation ledger technology in a global context.\" The test comes at a time when the science agency is also working with IBM to create what's been called the Australia National Blockchain. As CoinDesk previously reported, CSIRO aims to use this blockchain network to facilitate large-scale business and financial transactions for domestic and international enterprises based on blockchain-powered smart contracts."

        "detailedArticleContent": "Block.One is giving away its $4 billion code this weekend and it's anyone's guess what will happen next. As profiled by CoinDesk, EOS is set to launch sometime soon, though the company that built its code is going out of its way to prove the software really will be open-source. This means it isn't even designating an official launch. Rather, it's up to potential users to take it from there (whether that results in chaos or not). Right now, though, the question is whether or not EOS can successfully launch. Someone needs to launch the code. It needs to get tested and verified. Block producer candidates need to publicly identify themselves. One of them will need to be randomly chosen to create the genesis block, and then voting on the official first slate of block producers will take place. Even then, 15 percent of all the tokens in existence need to vote in order for EOS to turn on. This mean there's going to be a few interesting moments in this launch to watch for, which can be broken down into a series of questions. These include: Still, crypto-enthusiasts are likely to want to follow along whether or not they see EOS as progress or not. This is a huge new experiment for crypto, so those most invested in this technology will want to watch as closely as they can to see how this technological big bang spreads. Unfortunately, because it's so new, no one has created anything like a block explorer yet. There's not user-friendly tools for viewing vote counts or even seeing which block producers get chosen. There's also no official time for any of these events. And since different groups may attempt to initiate different launches, they might happen multiple times. The best way to follow along in real time will be the social media channels these teams have been using the communicate so far: EOS is open source code, meaning it's been publishing its work on GitHub all along. Block.One has released a few versions so far for teams to experiment with and develop on. A quick skim of the \"issues\" page on the EOS code repository shows that the number of issues (bugs, vulnerabilities and other problems) identified has been accelerating as it gets closer to launch. This is natural as the urgency becomes more severe and there are more eyes on the code, but if it explodes that could be a sign of serious issues. EOS Go has been the internet's collective cheerleader for EOS, working primarily on Steemit and YouTube to provide education about the launch process. They have a lot of streams planned for this weekend and watching on there might be one of the easiest ways to follow along. The group has already done live interviews with all the major block producer candidates, and they will be key to setting up the network. With lines of communication open to all those groups, they should know what's going on, minute by by minute. It's just going to be a lot of video to get through. There are extended streams planned throughout the weekend. One for several hours on Saturday, two on Sunday and two on Monday. Look for them to talk live with block producers around the world as the code gets tested and then ultimately launched. We're sorry about this, but yes: Telegram channels. The smart bet will probably be to go to the @EOSBlockPros channel, where block producer candidates (the groups vying for the lucrative spots validating transactions on the network) will discuss what's going on. There's also a general EOS channel, but like most community wide Telegram channels that's mostly people asking the same questions over and over again. This weekend, that will almost certainly be: \"What can I do if I didn't create an EOS wallet before June 1?\" Provided EOS (or a few versions of the software) launch successfully, it shouldn't be long until developers spin up some more direct ways to peer into its governance system, such as portals for viewing transaction volumes, staked votes and the average size of blocks. During this launch, though, all of that will be hidden in the bowels of servers."

        "creationDate": "2024-04-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Ethena Labs conducted an extensive airdrop campaign on April 2, distributing $450 million worth of Ethena tokens to several eligible wallets. The airdrop, which is a common strategy used by crypto projects to increase token distribution and engage the community, was completed by 7:17 am UTC, with the tokens being listed for trading on various reputed centralized exchanges subsequently. The largest share of the airdrop went to wallet 0xb56, which received a staggering 3.3 million Ethena tokens, valued at approximately $1.96 million. This substantial allocation highlights the scale of Ethena Labs' distribution and the potential impact on the token's market dynamics. Airdrops are often used by blockchain projects to reward early adopters, incentivize participation, or distribute tokens to a broad user base. The distribution of tokens directly to users' wallets can help in achieving more decentralized ownership of tokens and stimulate trading activity as recipients are free to hold, sell, or trade their assets. The listing of Ethena tokens on major centralized exchanges is a pivotal step for Ethena Labs, offering liquidity to token holders and enabling a wider audience to gain exposure to the token. The move can potentially drive up demand and value if the project backing the token garners positive attention and adoption. However, such large-scale airdrops and listings also come with risks. There is always the possibility of market manipulation, price volatility, and regulatory scrutiny, especially with wallets receiving large sums of tokens that could influence market movements if the tokens are sold in a short period. In the context of broader industry trends, Ethena Labs' airdrop fits into a pattern where blockchain projects look to expand their reach and establish a foothold in the competitive crypto market. As the crypto and blockchain sectors continue to evolve, airdrops remain a popular mechanism among projects to foster community engagement and increase the distribution of their native tokens. The success of such airdrops and token listings often hinges on the underlying value and utility of the project. For Ethena Labs, the future will depend on how well the project delivers on its promises and whether it can maintain the community's interest and trust. As the Ethena tokens enter the trading phase, the market's reaction and adoption by investors and users alike will be closely monitored by stakeholders and industry observers. With the ever-growing interest in digital assets and decentralized platforms, the performance of new tokens like Ethena's provides insights into market sentiment and the evolving landscape of the crypto economy.

        "creationDate": "2024-04-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Paradigm, a leading crypto investment firm, is reportedly in advanced discussions to raise as much as $850 million for a new fund. This development comes as a bold step and a strong signal of continued investor interest in the digital assets sector despite the volatile market conditions. The fundraising target, if reached, would represent the most considerable sum amassed for a crypto-focused fund since May 2022, underscoring a resilient appetite for long-term investment in blockchain technology and digital currencies. Paradigm's initiative follows its previous success in November 2021, where the firm raised a $2.5 billion fund, one of the largest of its kind at the time. The proposed $750 million, which could stretch to $850 million with the final closing, indicates Paradigm's commitment to deepening its footprint in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The firm is known for its strategic investments across various segments within the crypto ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 platforms. Paradigm's move comes at a time when the crypto industry is navigating through a period of consolidation and regulatory scrutiny. The market has witnessed significant downturns and high-profile collapses, such as the fall of Terra\/LUNA ecosystem and the bankruptcy of the once-prominent exchange FTX. However, investors like Paradigm are doubling down on their belief in the long-term potential of digital assets and blockchain technology. The fundraising efforts also highlight the broader trends in the venture capital sphere, where despite the overall slowdown in funding due to economic headwinds, specialized funds with deep expertise in niche areas like crypto continue to attract substantial capital. This dynamic suggests a maturing market where seasoned investors are looking beyond short-term volatility and focusing on foundational technologies that could shape the future of finance and internet infrastructure. Paradigm's track record and the pedigree of its leadership, including co-founders Fred Ehrsam, former Coinbase executive, and Matt Huang, former Sequoia Capital partner, have been instrumental in garnering investor confidence. Their previous fund's performance, which has backed successful projects and companies in the crypto space, is an encouraging sign for potential backers of the new fund. As the cryptocurrency sector awaits more regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, the successful closure of Paradigm's fund could serve as a bellwether for the industry's health and investor sentiment. It may also pave the way for other investment firms to follow suit and raise significant capital, further propelling the growth and innovation in the crypto domain. In conclusion, Paradigm's ambitious fundraising goal reflects a strong conviction in the transformative power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. It marks a significant moment for the ecosystem, which continues to attract serious investment despite the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead. Image source: Shutterstock"

The study also highlights the region's strong engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi) and preference for centralized exchanges.",
        "creationDate": "2024-04-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Bitget Research, the research arm of a prominent cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has released a comprehensive report examining the structure and current landscape of the cryptocurrency markets in Western Europe. The report sheds light on the region's growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, with a substantial number of daily active traders estimated to be between 1.2 million and 1.5 million. Germany and France have emerged as the frontrunners in terms of crypto trading activity in Western Europe. However, Austria has experienced remarkable growth, recording a 70% increase in crypto traders between December 2022 and December 2023. The report attributes this surge to the country's progressive approach to cryptocurrency investments. The study highlights the well-educated and risk-conscious nature of Western European crypto traders. They employ a trading strategy that combines contracts and spot trading, while also investing in mainstream assets. Additionally, the region's traders actively participate in decentralized projects, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 platforms. Popular chain ecosystems like Solana have garnered significant interest from Western European users. Notably, the report reveals that DeFi usage constitutes a major portion of cryptocurrency activity in Western Europe, while peer-to-peer (P2P) trading volumes remain relatively low. This trend can be attributed to the prevalent practice of purchasing digital assets using fiat deposits or linked cards in the region. Compared to other regions, Western Europe benefits from a clearer level of compliance in the cryptocurrency industry. Countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands adhere to the legislative framework established by the European Union for regulating crypto assets. The report also examines the trading preferences of Western European crypto traders. While centralized exchanges (CEX) remain the preferred choice for the majority of users, decentralized exchanges (DEX) like PancakeSwap and Uniswap have gained popularity among those opting for a decentralized approach. Cryptocurrency wallets such as Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, Bitget Wallet, and TrustWallet are widely used across the eight countries analyzed. Looking ahead, Bitget Research predicts several key trends for the Western European market in 2024. Germany and France are expected to maintain their status as cryptocurrency hubs, while interest in on-chain solutions, particularly NFTs, DEXes, and blockchain games, is projected to continue growing. The report suggests that decentralized exchanges will cater to the increasing demand for on-chain transactions, while emerging centralized exchanges may attract Western European users by offering superior customer service and platform features. Furthermore, crypto wallets that offer integration across multiple blockchain ecosystems are likely to benefit from increased engagement with projects in the Solana ecosystem. As Western Europe continues to play a significant role in the cryptocurrency industry, the region's responsible and regulated approach, coupled with a large number of daily active traders, underscores its importance in shaping the future of cryptocurrencies.

        "detailedArticleContent": "HKVAEX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has announced a phased suspension of its services, culminating in the full closure of its platform. This decision comes amidst a backdrop of increasing regulatory scrutiny in the global cryptocurrency industry. HKVAEX's service suspension coincides with a period of heightened regulatory focus, especially in regions like Hong Kong where financial authorities are striving to establish clear frameworks for virtual asset service providers. The immediate suspension of new user registrations and virtual asset deposit services was the first step, signaling the beginning of the end for HKVAEX. The subsequent cessation of trading services is slated for April 5, 2024, marking a critical point where users will be unable to execute new trades or maintain existing ones. The platform has advised users to withdraw their assets by April 30, 2024, before the official website is delisted on May 1, 2024. HKVAEX's abrupt shutdown may be linked to its licensing struggles. According to reports, the exchange applied for a regulatory license with Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on January 4, 2024, but withdrew the application on March 28, 2024. The South China Morning Post had earlier revealed that this license application was part of Binance's efforts to secure a compliant operational status within the region. The regulatory landscape in Hong Kong is known for its stringent approach to cryptocurrency operations. The SFC requires exchanges to adhere to strict anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, along with the protection of investors' interests. HKVAEX's failure to secure a license suggests potential difficulties in meeting these regulatory demands. The implications of HKVAEX's closure on the broader cryptocurrency market are significant, especially for the Asia-Pacific region, which has been a hub for crypto activity. As traditional financial centers like Hong Kong continue to grapple with the integration of digital assets into their regulatory frameworks, the closure of HKVAEX may be indicative of a larger trend of consolidation and attrition within the industry. As exchanges around the world navigate through regulatory complexities, the closure of HKVAEX raises questions about the future of cryptocurrency trading platforms in heavily regulated environments. It also underscores the importance for users to remain vigilant about the platforms they use and the regulatory changes that could affect their investments. For those affected by the closure of HKVAEX, the platform has assured that post-delisting support will be available via email for assistance with asset withdrawals or other concerns. However, this event serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency industry and the ever-present need for compliance with local regulations. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently announced the introduction of Ethena (ENA) on their Launchpool platform. ENA is a synthetic dollar protocol designed to offer users a stable and decentralized digital currency solution. With the launch of ENA on Binance Launchpool, users now have the opportunity to farm ENA tokens by staking their BNB (Binance Coin) and FDUSD (a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar). This farming process will take place over a three-day period, starting from March 30, 2024, at 00:00 UTC. Once the farming period concludes, ENA will be officially listed on the Binance exchange on April 2, 2024, at 08:00 UTC. Trading pairs available for ENA will include ENA\/BTC, ENA\/USDT, ENA\/BNB, ENA\/FDUSD, and ENA\/TRY. Here are some important details about the ENA Launchpool: Token Name: Ethena (ENA) Max Token Supply: 15,000,000,000 ENA Launchpool Token Rewards: 300,000,000 ENA (2% of max token supply) Initial Circulating Supply: 1,425,000,000 ENA (9.5% of max token supply) Smart Contract Details: Ethereum Staking Terms: KYC required To participate in the ENA Launchpool, users will need to stake their BNB and FDUSD tokens.

Users are advised to conduct their own research and exercise caution to ensure the security of their funds. It's important to note that participation in the ENA Launchpool may be subject to eligibility requirements based on the user's country or region of residence. Some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Cuba, Iran, Japan, and the United States, among others, may be excluded from participating in the ENA farming process. Binance continues to provide innovative opportunities for its users within the cryptocurrency space. Interested individuals are encouraged to stay informed and join the Ethena Launchpool to take advantage of the farming opportunity and earn ENA tokens by staking BNB and FDUSD.

        "articleSummary": "Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, discusses memecoins' current state and potential, suggesting alternative approaches like charity coins and Robin Hood games for a positive-sum experience, emphasizing the importance of combining charity initiatives with gaming mechanics.",
        "creationDate": "2024-03-29",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a recent blog post titled \"What else could memecoins be?\", Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, explores the current landscape of memecoins and contemplates their potential beyond the realm of meme culture. Buterin begins by reflecting on an article he wrote ten years ago, prior to the public announcement of the Ethereum project. In that article, he argued that issuing coins could be a novel way to fund important public projects. He envisioned a scenario where individuals could hold, accept, and trade coins tied to specific causes, thereby facilitating the funding of those causes. This idea of using coins as a means of large-scale funding stood apart from traditional market mechanisms and institutional frameworks. Fast forward to 2024, and memecoins have become a prominent topic of discussion within the crypto space. While memecoins like Dogecoin gained popularity in the past, the recent resurgence has left many feeling uneasy. Some Solana memecoins have been associated with racist content, and even non-racist memecoins often lack substantial value beyond speculative price fluctuations. The dissatisfaction surrounding memecoins raises important questions. Rather than merely expressing disdain for these ventures, Buterin suggests exploring alternative approaches that could provide a more positive-sum experience for participants. One such approach involves charity coins, where a significant portion of the token supply or ongoing fees are dedicated to charitable causes. Buterin highlights examples like \"GiveWell Inu\" and \"Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,\" which aimed to support GiveWell and cultural projects related to anti-aging research, respectively. While these initiatives had their shortcomings, they demonstrated the potential for combining cryptocurrency with philanthropy. Buterin also introduces the concept of Robin Hood games, where a memecoin's supply is partially allocated to support public goods valued by the community. This approach aims to improve upon the average user's experience by creating meaningful and entertaining games that leave lower-income players economically better off. By incorporating mechanisms that allow players to vote on the distribution of funds to various charities, both fun and charitable aspects can be combined. However, creating genuinely enjoyable games within the crypto space presents its own challenges. Buterin acknowledges the difficulties faced by projects like Axie Infinity in striking the right balance between fun and financial incentives. He expresses confidence in teams like 0xPARC, known for their success in developing crypto games like Dark Forest and FrogCrypto, which prioritize the pleasure of gameplay over monetary gains. In conclusion, Buterin urges the crypto community to adopt a more nuanced approach when evaluating memecoins. While he dismisses coins associated with scams or divisive ideologies, he recognizes the importance of fun and entertainment in the space. By promoting higher quality, positive-sum projects that contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem, the crypto space can evolve in a way that aligns with users' desires and values.

        "articleSummary": "US District Judge has dismissed an antitrust lawsuit targeting Apple, where Venmo and Cash App users claimed Apple Cash had an anti-competitive edge.",
        "creationDate": "2024-03-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a significant legal victory for Apple Inc., a lawsuit filed by customers of payment services like Venmo and Cash App was dismissed by US District Judge Vince Chhabria. The claim accused Apple of engaging in monopolistic practices with its Apple Cash service, which plaintiffs argued stifled competition and hindered the introduction of innovative features, such as decentralized cryptocurrency payments. The lawsuit targeted Apple's stronghold in the digital payment sector, asserting that the tech giant's practices were not only anti-competitive but also detrimental to consumer choice and technological advancement. The plaintiffs contended that Apple's alleged monopoly made it challenging for rivals to offer competitive pricing and enhance functionality, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrency integration. The dismissal of the case signals a reinforcement of the legal moat around Apple's business practices, particularly concerning its proprietary services and products. Apple Cash, integrated within the Apple ecosystem, allows for seamless transactions among iOS users, a feature the plaintiffs claimed was designed to edge out competition. However, Judge Chhabria\u2019s decision to dismiss the case underscores the complexity of antitrust litigation in the tech industry, especially when it involves accusations of stifling competition through in-house services. The ruling may set a precedent that could influence how forthcoming antitrust cases against major tech companies are approached, especially those that have ventured into financial services. This legal development occurs amidst a broader conversation about the role of big tech companies in financial services and their impact on the competitive landscape. With the rising interest in decentralized financial systems, such as those based on blockchain technology, there is an ongoing debate about how traditional banking services and payment platforms can adapt to include cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. In light of the dismissal, the future of digital wallet competition remains a contested domain, with big tech firms and fintech startups alike vying for a share of the lucrative market. Apple's position, supported by this legal outcome, may encourage the company to further integrate its services across its device ecosystem, potentially incorporating cryptocurrency features in the future. The case also highlights the growing scrutiny of tech giants' expansion into financial services, as regulators and competitors question the implications for consumer choice and market fairness. While this case against Apple has been dismissed, the intersection of technology, finance, and antitrust law continues to be an area of evolving legal challenges and debates. The implications of this decision are far-reaching, not just for Apple, but for the entire tech sector, which increasingly finds itself at the crossroads of innovation, regulation, and competitive practices.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-27",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United States Department of Justice has revealed that KuCoin, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and its founders, Chun Gan (also known as \"Michael\") and Ke Tang (also known as \"Eric\"), have been charged with criminal offenses related to the Bank Secrecy Act and unlicensed money transmission. According to the indictment, KuCoin and its founders conspired to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and violated the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program. The charges further allege that the exchange failed to implement proper customer verification procedures and did not file any suspicious activity reports. The indictment claims that KuCoin deliberately concealed the fact that a significant number of U.S. users were trading on its platform. Despite the large customer base, the exchange allegedly neglected to comply with U.S. laws designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. As a result, KuCoin reportedly received over $5 billion and sent over $4 billion of suspicious and criminal funds. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams emphasized that financial institutions like KuCoin must comply with U.S. law if they wish to operate in the United States. Williams stated, \"Crypto exchanges like KuCoin cannot have it both ways. Today's Indictment should send a clear message to other crypto exchanges: if you plan to serve U.S. customers, you must follow U.S. law, plain and simple.\" HSI Acting Special Agent in Charge Darren McCormack commended the investigation that exposed KuCoin's alleged multibillion-dollar criminal conspiracy. McCormack stated that despite servicing over 30 million customers, the exchange failed to follow laws necessary to ensure the security and stability of the digital banking infrastructure. KuCoin, founded in September 2017 by Chun Gan, Ke Tang, and others, solicited business from U.S. customers through its spot trading and futures trading platforms. Since its inception, the exchange has grown to become one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchange platforms, with daily trading volumes in the billions of dollars and millions of customers. The indictment marks a significant development in the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges and highlights the importance of enforcing anti-money laundering laws in the crypto industry. The charges against KuCoin and its founders serve as a reminder to other exchanges that compliance with U.S. law is essential when serving U.S. customers. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "In alignment with the upcoming 2024 Bitcoin Halving event, Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a unique educational campaign to boost crypto literacy, particularly focusing on Bitcoin Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This initiative is part of Binance's continued effort to encourage community engagement while educating users about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. A Dive Into Bitcoin NFTs Through Interactive Learning The 'Word of the Day' (WOTD) campaign, announced by Binance, is an interactive game designed to test and improve users' knowledge of Bitcoin NFTs. The campaign runs from March 25, 2024, to March 31, 2024, during which participants can earn Binance Points by playing the WOTD game. These points can be redeemed for rewards including USDT token vouchers and trading fee rebate vouchers. Participation and New User Engagement Participants can play two WOTD games daily, with a total of five correct answers across the Activity Period qualifying them to share the pool of 500,000 Binance Points. New users are also welcomed with open arms; those registering with the 'WOTD2024' referral code or through a specified referral link receive a 10% discount on spot trading fees, along with the chance to claim additional rewards within their first two weeks. Future-Proofing Crypto Knowledge This initiative is part of Binance's broader strategy to future-proof its users against the complexities of the crypto market. By focusing on NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, Binance is shedding light on a relatively new and growing aspect of the digital asset world that blends the scarcity and uniqueness of NFTs with the security and ubiquity of Bitcoin.

Participants are encouraged to play by the rules to maintain the integrity of the game and the platform. Disclaimer and Conclusion While Binance promotes these educational initiatives, they also caution users about the volatility and risk inherent in the crypto market. The platform advises users to invest wisely, acknowledging the importance of understanding the products and risks involved. Binance's crypto literacy campaign is not just a celebration of the Bitcoin Halving but also an important step in promoting informed participation in the crypto space. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "CoinList, a prominent platform for new token offerings and cryptocurrency trading, has recently announced the Bondex (BNDX) community sale, showcasing an innovative approach to decentralized talent networking. This sale marks the platform's continued commitment to fostering the growth of early-stage blockchain projects through community-driven initiatives. Following a successful series of sold-out community sales earlier this year, CoinList is set to commence the Bondex sale on March 21, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, which will run until March 28, 2024, at the same time. Bondex is positioned as a Web3 talent network that disrupts traditional profit-centric recruitment models, aiming to realign economic incentives between recruiters, talent, and companies. A key aspect of this announcement is CoinList's revamped approach to community sales. Noteworthy updates include an extended purchase window, allowing users to participate at their convenience within a 7-day period. This modification eliminates the need for participants to wake up at inconvenient hours to secure a spot in the often stressful queue system. Additionally, CoinList has removed the queue system in favor of a more equitable selection process. Users can now submit their purchase requests at any time during the sale window. CoinList will place a hold on the funds in the user's wallet, and successful requests will be randomly selected at the end of the purchase period. This system promises to streamline the experience and reduce anxiety for participants. The Bondex sale features 50 million BDXN tokens, representing 5% of the total supply, at a price of $0.08 per token. An additional allotment of 31.25 million tokens may be made available at Bondex's discretion. The tokenomics include a lockup and release schedule, where 25% of the tokens unlock after a 75-day period, with the remaining 75% vesting over 12 months. The initial purchase limits are set at a minimum of $50 and a maximum of $500, accepting only USDT\/USDC. The anticipation for the Bondex token exchange listing is high, with an expected date on or around June 11, 2024. Prior to the community sale, Bondex had conducted an incentivized rewards program on CoinList, resulting in over 75,000 users engaging with the platform by downloading the app and creating professional profiles. CoinList's announcement reinforces their mission to democratize access to crypto and blockchain innovations, ensuring a fair and stress-free participation experience for their community. As the industry evolves, CoinList continues to adapt its processes to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user base. Despite the excitement around the Bondex community sale, CoinList reminds potential participants of the legal disclaimer that the sale is not available for residents of the United States, China, Canada, South Korea, and certain other jurisdictions. The platform maintains its commitment to compliance and urges interested parties to consult local regulations before participating. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-03-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has issued a public statement urging caution among investors regarding the trading of virtual assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, in light of recent significant price fluctuations that have led to substantial losses for some traders. In the wake of tumultuous market conditions, the FSC emphasizes that virtual assets are highly speculative digital \"virtual commodities\" and not recognized as currency. They lack inherent value, and their trading prices are not subject to regulatory limits, resulting in potential steep rises and falls. The FSC advises citizens to thoroughly understand the operational models of these assets and to carefully assess the risks before engaging in transactions. The FSC also warns about the risks associated with using overseas virtual asset trading platforms. These platforms are not established under Taiwan's regulations, may not be regulated by foreign authorities, and the transparency of trading information can be questionable. The FSC recommends that the public exercise due diligence when considering such investments. For those seeking further information or with specific inquiries, the FSC has provided contact details for its Securities and Futures Bureau's Securities Firms Division. The rise of cryptocurrencies and digital assets has been one of the most transformative developments in the financial sector in recent years, drawing attention from regulators worldwide. With the FSC's latest advisory, Taiwan joins a list of countries that are actively working to educate their citizens on the potential risks associated with the volatile cryptocurrency market. The crypto market's rapid growth and the emergence of various digital assets have underscored the need for clear regulatory frameworks and investor education programs to ensure that participants are well-informed of the risks and the nature of their investments. While regulators like the FSC aim to protect consumers, they also face the challenge of fostering innovation and not stifling the growth of new financial technologies. The balance between regulation and innovation remains a central theme in the ongoing dialogue between financial authorities, investors, and industry participants. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-03-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, one of the globe's largest and most influential digital asset exchanges, has decided to delist three cryptocurrencies: DREP, Mobilecoin (MOB), and pNetwork (PNT). This action is set to take effect on April 3, 2024, at 03:00 (UTC) and comes as a significant move for traders and investors involved with these tokens. The decision to delist these assets stems from Binance's rigorous and periodic review process, designed to ensure that all listed cryptocurrencies meet the platform's high standard and industry requirements. Binance emphasizes the importance of protecting its users and adapting to the ever-evolving market dynamics. Several criteria inform the delisting process, including the team's commitment to the project, the level and quality of development activity, trading volume and liquidity, network stability, responsiveness to due diligence inquiries, and adherence to new regulatory requirements. The specific trading pairs affected by this decision include DREP\/BTC, DREP\/USDT, MOB\/BTC, MOB\/USDT, and PNT\/USDT. Post-delisting, all trade orders involving these pairs will be automatically removed. Binance has urged users to manage their trades and investments accordingly, as deposits of these tokens past April 4, 2024, will not be credited, and withdrawals will only be supported until July 3, 2024. Binance's ecosystem products, such as Binance Simple Earn, Auto-Invest, Loans, Margin, and others, will also phase out support for these tokens in line with the delisting schedule. The platform has provided detailed timelines for each service, advising users to take appropriate actions to avoid potential losses. For instance, Binance Loans will close all outstanding loan positions involving these tokens by March 28, 2024, and Margin trading pairs will be delisted by March 28, 2024. The delisting notice also highlighted that after the withdrawal deadline, delisted tokens might be converted into stablecoins at Binance's discretion, but this is not guaranteed. If such conversions occur, a separate notification will be issued to users. This delisting serves as a poignant reminder of the volatile and regulatory-complex nature of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the need for continuous compliance and quality assurance in the projects behind digital assets. For Binance, maintaining a robust and trustworthy platform for its users remains paramount, even when it necessitates tough decisions like these. Investors and traders are encouraged to stay informed and proactive in managing their cryptocurrency portfolios in light of such changes. With the industry's landscape continuously shifting, adaptability and attentiveness remain critical traits for success in the crypto space. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-03-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The former Chief Executive Officer of Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has teased the launch of a new project deeply rooted in educational efforts surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This news comes as the industry increasingly recognizes the importance of informed participation and knowledge-sharing in fostering a sustainable and inclusive digital economy. Changpeng Zhao, widely known as CZ, has indicated that this initiative will starkly contrast with many other cryptocurrency projects, by specifically excluding the creation or involvement of a new token. This approach aims to distance the endeavor from the financial speculation that often accompanies token launches, centering the project's focus on education and widespread blockchain literacy. While details remain scant at this stage, the announcement has already sparked interest across the crypto community, with stakeholders eager to understand the scope, nature, and potential impact of Zhao's educational project. With a promise of more information to come, there is speculation that the initiative could encompass a variety of formats, from online courses and workshops to educational materials and community outreach programs. Given Zhao's prominence in the industry and Binance's expansive user base, this initiative has the potential to make significant strides in cryptocurrency education. The lack of a token offering also suggests a commitment to providing public goods without immediate commercial incentives, a move that could help bolster the credibility and altruistic perception of the project. In the context of the broader crypto ecosystem, education has been pinpointed as a crucial factor in driving adoption and fostering a safer investment environment. Amidst regulatory scrutiny and a history of high-profile scams and misinformation, clear and accessible educational resources could play a critical role in mitigating risks for new entrants and empowering users with the knowledge to navigate the complex landscape of digital assets. As the industry awaits further details of Zhao's educational project, this announcement aligns with a broader trend of crypto platforms investing in educational initiatives. Major exchanges like Coinbase and platforms like Ethereum have also dedicated resources to improving blockchain literacy, underscoring the collective understanding that education is key to the sector's long-term success and public acceptance. Despite Zhao's departure from the executive role at Binance, his continued influence and commitment to the cryptocurrency community remain evident through this new venture. The project's forthcoming details will be closely watched by enthusiasts, industry players, and educational institutions alike, as they anticipate the potential contributions to a more knowledgeable and informed digital asset space.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Arkansas Representative French Hill is positioning himself to take the helm of the House Financial Services Committee, a move that could significantly impact the oversight and regulation of digital assets in the United States. As the current chair of the recently established digital assets subcommittee and vice-chair of the full committee, Hill has been at the forefront of exploring and understanding the intricacies of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The financial services committee plays a critical role in shaping policies that govern the nation's financial institutions, including banks, lenders, and credit markets. With the explosive growth of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing interest in blockchain applications, the committee's approach to these new technologies will likely affect how they are integrated into the broader financial system. Hill's leadership could mark a pivotal shift for the committee, which has conducted multiple hearings on crypto-related issues under his guidance. Notably, these hearings have delved into topics such as the potential for digital currencies to enhance financial services, the risks and benefits of emerging technologies, and the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure consumer protection and market integrity. The departure of Representative Patrick McHenry, who has also shown interest in fintech innovation, leaves a vacuum that Hill is well-positioned to fill. Hill's experience with digital assets could lead to a more nuanced and informed dialogue within the committee, potentially fostering a regulatory environment that encourages innovation while addressing the risks associated with digital currencies. Hill's potential leadership raises several questions about the future direction of cryptocurrency regulation. Will there be a push for more stringent oversight to protect investors from the volatility and potential fraud in the crypto space? Or will the committee lean towards a more laissez-faire approach to promote innovation and competitiveness in the global financial markets? The implications of Hill's ascension extend beyond the borders of the United States, as the country's regulatory stance influences international norms and practices. As cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology become increasingly global, the decisions made by the House Financial Services Committee under Hill's leadership could have far-reaching consequences for the industry worldwide. As the situation unfolds, all eyes will be on Hill and the financial services committee to see how they will navigate the complex and evolving landscape of digital assets. With the potential for groundbreaking legislation and regulatory frameworks on the horizon, the committee's actions will undoubtedly shape the future of finance in the digital age.

The exchange will also be launching USDⓈ-M BOME Perpetual Contracts, offering leverage of up to 50x, further diversifying the options available to traders on its platform.

In addition to the spot market listing, Binance Futures will expand its offerings with the launch of the USDⓈ-M BOME Perpetual Contract.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-15",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Despite facing international sanctions, North Korea's notorious Lazarus Group has allegedly resumed its operations using the crypto mixer Tornado Cash to launder approximately $12 million worth of cryptocurrencies. These funds are purportedly linked to cyber heists targeting cryptocurrency platforms HTX and HECO in November, highlighting the persistent threat posed by state-sponsored actors in the digital asset space. The Lazarus Group, which is believed to be backed by the North Korean government, has been implicated in a series of high-profile cyberattacks aimed at obtaining foreign currency to fund state operations, circumventing the economic sanctions imposed on the country. The latest incident underscores the sophisticated tactics employed by the group to navigate the complex web of decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency exchanges. According to reports, the stolen assets were initially transferred out of the hacked platforms and then converted into Ether tokens through various decentralized exchanges, a process that typically helps obfuscate the trail of the funds. Following the conversion, the funds remained dormant, possibly to avoid detection during the period of heightened scrutiny following the heists. This week, however, activity was detected as the funds began moving through Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing service designed to enhance transaction privacy by pooling and scrambling cryptocurrencies. It's important to note that Tornado Cash has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department, which has accused the service of being a conduit for money laundering activities, including those by the Lazarus Group. The use of sanctioned services like Tornado Cash by cybercriminals presents a significant challenge to international efforts to curb North Korea's illicit activities. The sanctions are meant to deter and penalize both the service providers and their users; however, the decentralized and borderless nature of blockchain technology makes enforcement a complex task. As the Lazarus Group continues its operations, the international community is called to strengthen its response and improve coordination among governments, financial institutions, and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Enhanced due diligence, robust cybersecurity measures, and the development of tools to trace and block the movement of illicit funds are critical in combating the misuse of digital assets. The persistence of such activities demonstrates the need for a multi-faceted approach that includes technological innovation, regulatory clarity, and international cooperation. The Lazarus Group's latest maneuvers through Tornado Cash highlight the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between cybercriminals and law enforcement, with implications for the security and integrity of the global financial system.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-15",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The UK High Court judge has dismissed the claims made by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright that he is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The case, which has been one of the most controversial claims in the history of cryptocurrency, saw Judge James Mellor reach a conclusion that Wright did not, in fact, create the Bitcoin system. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has been a mystery since the inception of Bitcoin, with the whitepaper introducing the digital currency published under this pseudonym in 2008. The absence of a definitive identity behind Bitcoin has led to multiple claims over the years, but Craig Wright's assertions have been the most persistent. Wright has, on several occasions, asserted that he is the mind behind the whitepaper that laid the groundwork for the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. Judge Mellor's ruling is expected to be detailed in a written statement, which will include the reasons behind the conclusion that Wright is not the creator of Bitcoin. This decision comes after a series of legal battles involving Wright, who has taken several individuals and entities to court over the denial of his claims. The legal proceedings have scrutinized evidence presented by Wright, but the scrutiny has not swayed the court's decisions in his favor. The ruling has significant implications not just for Wright but also for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. It reaffirms the anonymous and decentralized nature of Bitcoin's origins, which many see as a core tenet of its philosophy. The decision also highlights the challenges involved in proving the identity of someone involved in the creation of a technology designed to be autonomous and without a central authority. Looking back, this is not the first time Wright has faced legal challenges in relation to his claims. The crypto community has been largely skeptical of Wright's assertions, which has led to a fractious relationship between him and other industry figures. Other cryptocurrency exchanges and developers have been fined or reprimanded by authorities for various reasons, but this case is unique due to its focus on the identity of Bitcoin's creator. The broader implications of the ruling may open discussions on the legal recognition of digital identities and the proof required to substantiate claims in the highly speculative and technologically complex field of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it may influence future legal disputes where the identity of individuals behind key technological innovations is in question. The court's decision is a reminder of the ongoing debates and legal complexities surrounding the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. As the industry continues to evolve, the legal framework and recognition of digital and anonymous contributions remain areas of considerable interest and dispute. As the crypto community awaits the detailed written ruling from Judge Mellor, the case of Craig Wright versus the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto appears to have reached a significant milestone, with the court's dismissal of Wright's claims likely to resonate within the industry for some time.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong has today issued a stark warning to the public concerning an unlicensed virtual asset trading platform (VATP) known as Bybit. The SFC has advised potential investors to exercise caution when dealing with the platform, which is not licensed or registered in Hong Kong to conduct any regulated activities related to virtual assets.It is worth noting that on February 1, 2024, Bybit submitted an application for a Virtual Asset Trading Operator license to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Bybit, operated by Bybit Fintech Limited, a Seychelles-registered company, has been offering a suite of crypto-related products across various jurisdictions. These include futures contracts, options, leveraged tokens, and several investment products purportedly linked to the crypto market. The SFC has emphasized that none of the entities within the Bybit group holds a license to offer these services in Hong Kong. Engaging in the trading or marketing of crypto-related products that may be deemed \"futures contracts\" or \"securities\" under Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) without proper authorization is a criminal offense. Moreover, issuing advertisements or invitations related to such products to the Hong Kong public without the SFC's authorization is also illegal. The SFC has taken the step of listing Bybit on both the Suspicious Virtual Asset Trading Platforms Alert List and the Suspicious Investment Products Alert List, which were made public on March 14, 2024. This move underscores the regulatory body's commitment to safeguarding the integrity of Hong Kong's financial markets and protecting investors from potentially fraudulent or unregulated entities. In an era where virtual assets are becoming increasingly mainstream, the SFC's warning is a timely reminder of the inherent risks associated with unregulated platforms. Investors are urged to verify the licensing status of any platform offering investment opportunities in virtual assets. The warning highlights the potential difficulties in seeking recourse against unlicensed entities, especially those without a strong connection to Hong Kong, and warns that investors may face the total loss of their investments without the possibility of legal remedies. The SFC's action reflects a broader trend of regulatory bodies globally taking steps to protect investors in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. It is part of a concerted effort to ensure that platforms comply with local regulations, which are designed to provide transparency, security, and fairness for investors. The SFC has made it clear that it will not hesitate to take enforcement action against unlicensed activities. This serves as a warning not only to Bybit but to all virtual asset trading platforms operating without the necessary licenses in jurisdictions where such regulations are in place. In conclusion, the SFC's announcement is a critical reminder that diligence is key when navigating the complex world of virtual asset investments. Investors are encouraged to consult with the SFC's resources, including its FAQs and alert lists, to ensure they are making informed decisions in the virtual asset space. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "In honor of the holy month of Ramadan, global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced a unique event that allows users to share a pool of 50,000 FDUSD in trading fee rebate vouchers. The event, which aligns with the spirit of giving during Ramadan, commences on March 14, 2024, and concludes on March 28, 2024. Unlock the Moon: Collect, Trade, and Earn The event, aptly named \"Unlock the Moon,\" encourages users to engage in various trading activities to collect Fanoos Lantern icon cards. Participants can accumulate these cards by making a deposit of at least 50 FDUSD equivalent through Fiat Deposit, purchasing crypto with a Credit\/Debit Card, or using Binance P2P. Additionally, completing a trade of at least 100 FDUSD equivalent in qualified spot trading pairs will grant users additional cards. The qualified trading pairs include BTC\/FDUSD, BTC\/USDT, BNB\/FDUSD, BNB\/USDT, ETH\/FDUSD, and ETH\/USDT. To foster a community spirit, Binance incentivizes users to exchange their collected icon cards with friends or on social media, enhancing their chances to generate the \u201CMoon\u201D and claim their share of the rewards. Reward Distribution and Terms The reward for each qualified user will be calculated based on the proportion of icon cards they collect relative to the total number by all participants. However, individual rewards are capped at 10 FDUSD in trading fee rebate vouchers, ensuring a fair distribution among all users who successfully complete the tasks. The terms and conditions of the event stipulate that only verified users who unlock the \"Moon\" and complete a task during the event period will qualify for rewards. Binance also emphasizes that the availability of the activity may vary by region. Market and Community Impact This special event is expected to increase user engagement on the Binance platform, as traders participate to earn rewards while celebrating Ramadan. It also showcases Binance's commitment to cultural diversity and inclusivity, recognizing important occasions in various communities around the world. Binance has stated that trading fee rebate voucher rewards will be distributed within two weeks after the event concludes. Users can redeem their vouchers via the Rewards Hub in their profile. Ensuring Fair Participation Binance reserves the right to disqualify any participant engaging in wash trades or other manipulative behaviors. The exchange's message is clear - the spirit of fair play and community must guide the event, reflecting the values of Ramadan. Conclusion and Considerations Participants are reminded that despite the festive occasion, trading digital assets comes with significant risk due to market volatility. Binance encourages users to trade responsibly and to seek independent financial advice if necessary. This event is an innovative way for Binance to engage with its user base while respecting cultural practices, providing an opportunity for users to participate in the cryptocurrency market in a festive and potentially rewarding way.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ), a leading force in Bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure, has revealed its financial outcomes for the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year of 2023. With a remarkable performance in the self-mining sector and strategic operational improvements, Core Scientific stands as a testament to the potential resilience within the cryptocurrency industry. Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Highlights The financial results provided by Core Scientific for the fiscal year 2023 show a company emerging from restructuring with fortified strength. The company reported earning a total of 19,274 bitcoin within their data centers, with 13,762 bitcoin mined for their account, establishing them as the top publicly listed miner in North America. They also reported an impressive operated hash rate of 23.2 EH\/s and the management of 724 megawatts of infrastructure, which is the largest footprint among publicly listed miners in North America. The company's revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was $141.9 million, which represents an increase of $20.7 million from the previous year. The net loss decreased significantly to $195.7 million, marking an improvement of $239.2 million. Core Scientific also reported an adjusted EBITDA of $57.5 million, an increase of $51.2 million from the fourth quarter of the previous year. For the full fiscal year of 2023, the total revenue was $502.4 million, a decrease from the previous year, which was offset by a considerable decrease in net loss to $246.5 million, showing an improvement of $1.90 billion. The adjusted EBITDA for the year was $170.0 million, a notable increase from the negative figures of the previous year. Operational Excellence and Strategic Growth The CEO of Core Scientific, Adam Sullivan, expressed optimism for the company's trajectory, citing the growth plan and diversified platform as key factors enabling the company to upgrade their mining fleet and scale the business effectively. The company's focus on self-mining growth, which is projected to exceed 20 EH\/s, is set to capitalize on the current bitcoin prices and industry fundamentals. Core Scientific's financial improvements are attributed to the strategic termination of less profitable hosting contracts, the deployment of new, more efficient Bitmain S21 miners, and a reduction in operating expenses. The company has also broadened its revenue model through a new contract with CoreWeave, Inc., expanding into high-performance computing tailored for AI demands. Looking Ahead As Core Scientific moves into 2024, the company's strategic planning and operational enhancements position it advantageously for the future, particularly with the anticipated bitcoin halving event. This event, expected to occur in 2024, typically has a significant impact on the bitcoin mining industry due to the reduction in the bitcoin reward for mining new blocks. The company's success in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 sets a positive tone for the upcoming year. With a robust infrastructure and a focus on high-value compute domains, Core Scientific is poised to continue its role as a leader in the digital asset industry. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-03-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In the ongoing legal tussle between Yuga Labs, Inc. and defendants Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen, recent court documents filed in the Central District of California allege non-compliance with court orders, potentially setting a significant precedent in the world of digital assets and intellectual property. Yuga Labs, known for its popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs, filed a response to the defendants' declarations related to a court order under 15 U.S.C. §1116(a). According to the filed document, defendants are accused of attempting to undermine the court's authority by allegedly engaging in misleading actions and failing to adhere to the court's judgment. The case number is 2:22-cv-04355-JFW-JEM. The court documents suggest that defendant Ryder Ripps, in an apparent act of non-compliance, destroyed private keys to cryptocurrency wallets containing the disputed NFTs, thus preventing the transfer or destruction of the NFTs as ordered by the court. The controversy centers around the \"RR\/BAYC\" NFTs, which Yuga Labs claims infringe upon their trademarks and intellectual property. Yuga Labs' filing argues that Ripps\u2019 actions have frustrated the purpose of the court's injunction, intended to allow Yuga Labs to \"regain control over the instrumentalities of commerce that bear its BAYC Marks and allow Yuga to protect its brand and prevent future harm.\" The defendants also stand accused of failing to pay stipulated attorney\u2019s fees and reimbursements for Special Master fees as part of the court's judgment. These allegations, if proven true, could result in sanctions or a contempt ruling against the defendants. This legal battle highlights the complexities and challenges of enforcing intellectual property rights within the blockchain space, where digital assets such as NFTs exist in a decentralized and often pseudonymous environment. As the case develops, the outcome could have significant implications for the NFT community and the broader cryptocurrency market. It underscores the importance of legal frameworks that can adapt to the unique properties of blockchain technology while protecting the rights of creators and stakeholders. Yuga Labs has requested the court to compel Mr. Ripps to provide a detailed declaration under penalty of perjury, including disclosing all wallet addresses that have held RR\/BAYC NFTs and whether he has the means to access those wallets. The legal proceedings underscore the nascent state of law concerning digital assets and the necessity for a robust legal framework to address disputes in the blockchain and NFT domains. The ramifications of this case could extend beyond the involved parties, potentially shaping future regulatory and legal standards in the digital asset space. The case continues to unfold, with the cryptocurrency and legal communities keeping a close watch on the implications of the court's decisions. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-03-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago has announced the seizure of approximately $1.4 million in Tether (USDT), a cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar, in connection with an alleged tech support scam that primarily targeted elderly victims throughout the United States. The seizure, one of the first instances of the U.S. government recovering USDT from an unhosted virtual currency wallet, was carried out through a court-authorized warrant. According to Acting U.S. Attorney Morris Pasqual and FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Robert W. \"Wes\" Wheeler, Jr., the alleged fraud scheme involved a computer popup indicating that the victim's computer had been compromised. The popup instructed the victim to contact Microsoft or Apple, depending on their operating system, at a provided telephone number. Once on the phone, perpetrators posing as tech support employees informed the victim that their bank account had also been compromised. The scammers then transferred the call to others posing as employees of the victim's bank's fraud department. They convinced the victims to convert money from their traditional bank accounts into cryptocurrency to keep it \"safe\" from hackers. The funds were subsequently transferred into unhosted virtual currency wallets controlled by the perpetrators. The FBI's most recent Internet Crime Report estimated that tech support scams caused losses exceeding $924 million in 2023. The U.S. Attorney's Office acknowledged Tether for its assistance in effectuating the transfer of the seized assets, which will be returned to the victims of the fraud scheme. The seizure was a collaborative effort involving the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago, the FBI's Chicago Field Office, and the Justice Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven J. Dollear is representing the government in this case. As authorities continue to investigate the alleged fraud scheme, this seizure serves as a warning to scammers targeting vulnerable populations and demonstrates the U.S. government's commitment to combating cryptocurrency-related crimes. It also highlights the importance of educating the public, especially the elderly, about potential scams and the need for caution when dealing with unsolicited tech support communications. The growing prevalence of cryptocurrency scams targeting the elderly is a concerning trend. Scammers often exploit the lack of familiarity with technology and cryptocurrency among older individuals to manipulate them into transferring funds to fraudulent wallets. Educating the elderly about the risks associated with unsolicited tech support calls and the importance of verifying the legitimacy of any financial transaction is crucial in preventing such scams. Furthermore, this case underscores the significance of collaboration between law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, and cryptocurrency platforms in combating fraud. Tether's assistance in the seizure of the fraudulent funds demonstrates the importance of cooperation between the public and private sectors in identifying and preventing financial crimes. As the use of cryptocurrency continues to grow, it is essential for regulators and law enforcement agencies to adapt their strategies to effectively investigate and prosecute crypto-related crimes. The successful seizure of the Tether funds in this case serves as an example of the U.S. government's increasing capability to trace and recover illicit cryptocurrency proceeds. Moving forward, it is crucial for authorities to continue their efforts in raising awareness about cryptocurrency scams, particularly among vulnerable populations, and to work closely with the crypto industry to develop robust security measures and regulations to prevent such fraudulent activities. By taking a proactive approach to combating cryptocurrency fraud, we can create a safer financial ecosystem for all users, regardless of their age or technological proficiency.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Aevo has earmarked a massive 30 million $AEVO tokens for distribution. The airdrop aims to reward users based on several criteria, including volume traded before and during their 'farm boost' phase, aeUSD balance, the initiation of the first trade on Aevo, and overall active utilization of the platform. Aevo is a high-speed decentralized derivatives exchange focused on options trading. It utilizes a custom Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) roll-up that settles on the Ethereum blockchain. Aevo has an off-chain order book where trades are matched, but settlements occur on-chain via smart contracts. This hybrid model combines the speed of off-chain order matching with the security of on-chain settlement. By leveraging roll-up technology, Aevo can offer a derivatives exchange with the decentralization and trustlessness of Ethereum, but with vastly greater throughput and lower fees compared to trading directly on the Ethereum mainnet. Understanding the diversity of its user base, Aevo has carefully crafted their reward system to appreciate long-standing users, those experimenting with collateral options, and genuine trading activities. In contrast, punitive measures have been outlined against accounts that have attempted to exploit the system through deep out-of-the-money (OTM) options and wash trading activities. Aevo has also set a deadline for the airdrop claims, stating that any unclaimed tokens will be retracted after six months from the date of the airdrop. This adds an element of urgency for users to engage with the platform and claim their rewards. In a nod to inclusivity, Aevo's airdrop extends beyond its existing user base. Traders who have not previously engaged with Aevo but have been active on other derivative decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are also recognized. These non-Aevo traders have been allotted farm boosts, which can be claimed and utilized to potentially earn between 2 to 4 times more $AEVO tokens when they commence trading on Aevo. Additionally, Aevo has not overlooked their veRBN max lockers, hinting at an upcoming targeted activity to engage this group further, with more details to be revealed in the upcoming weeks. Aevo's team is also preparing to launch a new trading incentives campaign to encourage further staking and trading on their platform. As part of their communication strategy, Aevo is inviting users to subscribe for the latest updates directly to their inbox, ensuring that interested parties are well-informed about future developments and opportunities. For those interested in the intersection of cryptocurrency and blockchain collectibles, Aevo has made it possible to mint the airdrop announcement as a non-fungible token (NFT) to add to one's collection, demonstrating their innovative approach to engaging with the crypto community.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The leading cryptocurrency exchange has announced the introduction of a flat taker fee on USDT trading pairs in selected fiat markets. This development underscores the platform's commitment to creating a more structured fee framework for its customers. Starting from March 19, 2024, at 00:00 (UTC), Binance P2P will implement a flat taker fee of 0.05 USDT per trade order on USDT trading pairs within the P2P Zone. This fee structure is set to be progressively applied and is expected to be fully implemented by the end of June 2024. The fiat markets affected by this new fee policy include an extensive list of currencies, featuring but not limited to AED, AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, INR, and USD. This move is part of Binance's ongoing efforts to streamline its fee system and enhance the trading experience on the platform. While the new taker fee will affect a broad range of fiat markets, it is important to note that the maker fee rates on the P2P Zone will remain unchanged. Traders who provide liquidity to the market by creating orders will not incur additional costs, thus incentivizing market-making activities. The implementation of this fee comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is witnessing increased regulatory scrutiny and a call for transparent and fair fee structures. Binance's decision to standardize fees across various markets aligns with the industry's movement towards greater transparency. For those new to the platform, Binance has provided resources such as an introduction to P2P trading and a newbie guide to assist users in navigating the P2P marketplace. These guides are instrumental in helping users understand the dynamics of P2P trading and how to effectively engage in the market. As with any trading decision, participants on the Binance P2P platform are advised to exercise due diligence and remain aware of the volatile nature of digital asset prices. The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate considerably, which may impact the returns from trading activities. Binance has emphasized that it reserves the right to amend or cancel the announced fee structure at any time without prior notice. This discretionary power ensures that the platform can adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements. The introduction of a flat taker fee on USDT trading pairs is an important step for Binance as it seeks to optimize its service offerings and maintain its position as a leading digital asset platform. This change reflects the exchange's ongoing commitment to providing a fair and efficient trading environment for its global user base. As the full impact of the new fee structure unfolds, participants on the Binance P2P platform are encouraged to stay informed and adjust their trading strategies accordingly to navigate the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

        "detailedArticleContent": "VanEck, a global investment manager renowned for its forward-thinking financial products, has made a strategic move to attract investors to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. As of March 12, 2024, VanEck announced an enticing fee waiver for their VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), a fund that provides exposure to spot Bitcoin prices. The bold initiative sees VanEck waiving the entire sponsor fee for the first $1.5 billion in assets under management within the Trust. This waiver is effective immediately and will remain in place until March 31, 2025. For assets exceeding the $1.5 billion mark before this date, a nominal fee of 0.20% will be charged. This fee structure ensures that all investors, regardless of the size of their investment, will benefit from the same competitive rates. The move is a testament to VanEck's commitment to delivering value to investors and reshaping fee structures to align with investor expectations and market dynamics. \"Listening to our clients is pivotal, and in doing so, we continue to evolve our offerings to provide investment opportunities that are both competitive and meet the needs of our investors,\" commented Kyle DaCruz, Director of Digital Assets Product at VanEck. This is not VanEck's first foray into the crypto space. The firm made headlines in 2017 as the first established ETF issuer to file for a bitcoin-linked ETF. Additionally, VanEck's European arm manages a suite of 12 crypto ETPs. Besides HODL, the firm's digital assets fund family includes the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) and the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP). With the fee waiver, VanEck aims to encourage a broader range of investors to consider Bitcoin as a viable component of their investment portfolios. The decision may also spark further interest in the cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to increased adoption and investment in the sector. VanEck's approach to investment is deeply rooted in identifying impactful opportunities beyond traditional financial markets. The firm's history dates back to 1955, and it was among the first U.S. asset managers to provide access to international markets. As of January 31, 2024, VanEck managed approximately $88.2 billion in assets, demonstrating the firm's significant influence on the investment management industry. Investors considering the VanEck Bitcoin Trust should be aware of the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin, including its high volatility and the potential for rapid declines in value. The Trust aims to reflect the performance of Bitcoin less the expenses of operations and does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Bitcoin. The announcement of the fee waiver has been well-received in the cryptocurrency community, with many viewing it as a positive development for the industry. As the digital asset market continues to mature, actions like this from established financial institutions serve to validate the legitimacy and potential of cryptocurrencies as an asset class.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "South Korea's National Tax Service (NTS) has taken a significant step forward by initiating the development of an 'Integrated Cryptocurrency Management System.' Aimed at bolstering tax compliance and combating evasion, the system is scheduled for completion in 2025. The move comes at a time when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen a resurgence in market interest, with Bitcoin reaching a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. The investment in cryptocurrencies has surged, particularly following the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the United States, which has fueled a rapid increase in cryptocurrency investments. To address the regulatory challenges posed by the anonymity and decentralization inherent in cryptocurrency transactions, the NTS has chosen GtiC as the leading consultant for the preliminary phase of the system's construction. The system will analyze and manage transactional information collected under the mandate that obligates virtual asset service providers to report their transaction details. The push for a comprehensive system to monitor virtual asset transactions is driven by the increasing prevalence of money laundering, unconventional inheritance and gift transfers, and offshore tax evasion associated with cryptocurrency dealings. Although virtual asset service providers have been obligated to report transaction data following amendments to the Corporate Tax Act and Income Tax Act, there has been an absence of an adequate system to analyze and manage this information. By establishing the 'Integrated Cryptocurrency Management System,' the NTS aims to prevent tax evasion using cryptocurrencies and ensure fair taxation. This initiative aligns with the global trend of increasing regulatory scrutiny over virtual assets. According to a report by PwC, the European Union is in the process of establishing market regulations for virtual assets, and the United States has introduced new tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrencies. These regulatory efforts are based on recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and aim to maintain the transparency and order of financial markets, prevent crimes and misuse, and protect investors. The NTS's system is expected to increase the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, aiding in the prevention of tax evasion and the realization of fair taxation. As the world increasingly moves towards a regulated cryptocurrency environment, South Korea's proactive steps in this direction are a noteworthy development in the global financial landscape. The news of South Korea's tax authority developing an 'Integrated Cryptocurrency Management System' is a testament to the country's commitment to adapting to the evolving financial ecosystem and maintaining compliance with international standards.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a hard fork strategy. This preemptive measure is designed to protect user funds in the event that quantum computers become capable of breaking current cryptographic defenses. The proposal, outlined in a discussion on the Ethereum Research forum, highlights the urgency of preparing for quantum computers' ability to solve problems like the discrete logarithm, which underpins the security of many current cryptographic algorithms including those used by Ethereum. The proposed hard fork would entail the following steps: Reversion of all blocks following the detection of large-scale quantum attacks. Disabling traditional externally owned account (EOA) transactions to prevent further vulnerability. Introduction of a new transaction type for smart contract wallets, in line with the anticipated RIP-7560 standard. Implementation of a new transaction type or opcode allowing users to submit STARK proofs, demonstrating the knowledge of a private preimage and a public address derived through approved hash functions. The user's account code would then be replaced with a new, quantum-resistant validation code. The conversation in the Ethereum community is informed by a range of expert inputs. One participant shared a visual aid to help understand the proof statement, while others discussed existing quantum-secure fallbacks for wallets and the integration of preimages into ECDSA signature nonces to create fail-stop signature schemes. Some community members have cautioned that if quantum computers capable of cracking Ethereum wallets are already in malicious hands, it might be too late to differentiate between legitimate owners and attackers. They suggest that instead of relying on stateful post-quantum algorithms, Ethereum should use NIST standardized ones in hybrid mode with a classical algorithm, like combining Dilithium with ed25519. This would, however, increase block sizes due to the large signature and public key sizes of current post-quantum schemes. Others have proposed the development of machine learning systems to monitor and detect abnormal transactions as an early warning system to trigger a fail-safe fork. The community's response underlines the importance of staying ahead in the security arms race against quantum computing. Innovations such as Lamport signatures and ERC 4337-based quantum-resistant smart contract wallets are already in development, as is the integration of quantum-safe cryptographic measures in other digital signature applications. This initiative by the Ethereum community reflects the broader blockchain ecosystem's commitment to resilience and adaptability in the face of emerging technological threats. As quantum computing advances, the blockchain sector's proactive stance on security promises to be a critical factor in its long-term viability and trustworthiness. The Ethereum team and community's proactive approach to quantum security demonstrates a clear recognition of the challenges ahead and a willingness to address them head-on. This ongoing conversation will likely shape the future of Ethereum's infrastructure and set a precedent for other blockchain platforms. Image source: Shutterstock"

Sustainable and Responsible Mining Practices As environmental concerns become increasingly paramount, Compass Mining emphasizes sustainability. The company partners with data centers that utilize renewable energy sources, aligning with the broader industry's shift towards \"green\" mining practices. This commitment is crucial not only for reducing the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining but also for the industry's long-term viability and public perception. Navigating Regulatory Challenges Regulatory scrutiny remains a significant challenge for the crypto industry, including the mining sector. Compass Mining operates with transparency and compliance, navigating the complex regulatory landscape to ensure that clients' mining activities adhere to local and international regulations. This approach not only protects clients but also fosters a more stable and mature mining industry. The Future of Compass Mining and Crypto Mining Industry Looking ahead, Compass Mining is poised to play an influential role in shaping the future of the mining industry. With plans to expand its global data center partnerships and enhance its service offerings, the company is well-positioned to support the growing demand for Bitcoin mining. As the industry evolves, Compass Mining's continued innovation and commitment to accessibility, sustainability, and regulatory compliance will be instrumental in promoting a more decentralized and robust mining ecosystem.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "FTX and Alameda Research have reached an agreement to settle disputes with the crypto lender BlockFi, potentially paying up to $874 million. This settlement marks a pivotal step in the unfolding saga of the 2022 cryptocurrency market downturn that led to a series of high-profile insolvencies. The settlement agreement, which is subject to court approval, was detailed in a filing on March 6, 2024, indicating a resolution that could lead to substantial recoveries for BlockFi's customers. According to the terms, BlockFi is to receive an allowed customer claim of $185.2 million against FTX.com, representing the full value of its assets on the exchange, and a claim of $689.3 million against Alameda Research for loans provided by BlockFi. BlockFi entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in November 2022, following the shock collapse of FTX earlier that month. The legal battles that ensued between BlockFi and FTX through 2023 reflected the intricate financial entanglements and the subsequent fallout within the crypto industry. The proposed settlement is poised to treat $250 million of the total sum as a \u201Csecured claim,\u201D offering BlockFi a prioritized payment after FTX emerges from bankruptcy. This amount is part of the funds owed to BlockFi by Alameda Research, with the remaining contingent on FTX's ability to reimburse its own customers and other creditors. The agreement was reached with the assistance of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey in Wilmington, Delaware, and involved early mediation that led to reduced litigation costs. The successful negotiation of this settlement underscores the complexity and interdependence of crypto financial operations, highlighting the risks associated with digital asset lending and borrowing. As part of the agreement, BlockFi has agreed to drop its lawsuit regarding 56 million Robinhood shares allegedly pledged as collateral for loans to Alameda Research. This aspect of the settlement came after the U.S. Department of Justice seized these equity shares following the arrest of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. While the resolution represents a significant milestone for BlockFi, the broader implications for the crypto industry remain to be seen. The settlement may set a precedent for how crypto-related bankruptcy claims are handled in the future, especially those involving intertwined financial relationships between lending platforms and exchange entities. BlockFi's customers hold their breath as the confirmation of the agreement could enable withdrawals and potential recovery of assets. The BlockFi administration has expressed gratitude to customers for their patience and to the judicial system for facilitating a value-maximizing resolution. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the BlockFi settlement with FTX and Alameda Research serves as a reminder of the industry's growing pains and the necessity for robust risk management practices.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In anticipation of the highly anticipated Bitcoin Halving event, Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has unveiled a special promotion to reward its users. The campaign, which was announced on March 6, 2024, will distribute a whopping 13,000 FDUSD in token vouchers among participants who purchase Bitcoin (BTC) using the platform's \"Buy Crypto\" feature. Bitcoin Halving Spurs Binance's Generous Incentive The Bitcoin Halving is a significant event in the cryptocurrency world, occurring approximately every four years. It reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half, thereby slowing down the rate at which new bitcoins are generated. This event has historically impacted Bitcoin's price and market dynamics, making it a focal point for investor interest. In light of this event, Binance's promotion is set to run from March 11, 2024, until April 7, 2024, and is divided into two distinct parts to cater to both new and existing users of the \"Buy Crypto\" feature. Promotion A: A Warm Welcome with Rewards Promotion A is tailored for users who have not used the \"Buy Crypto\" feature before the start of the promotion period. The first 3,000 eligible participants who register for the activity and purchase a minimum of $30 worth of BTC will each receive a 3 FDUSD token voucher. Promotion B: Competitive Trading with Hefty Rewards More seasoned traders haven't been left out. Promotion B is open to users who have previously used the \"Buy Crypto\" feature. To qualify, participants must confirm their registration and reach a minimum total BTC purchase volume of $500 during the promotion period. The top 500 buyers, based on total BTC purchase volume, will share a prize pool of 4,000 FDUSD, with rewards ranging from 20 to 100 FDUSD depending on their rank. Terms and Additional Opportunities Binance has highlighted that users must click [Join Now] on the activity page and complete account verification to be eligible for rewards. The availability of the \"Buy Crypto\" feature varies by region, and purchases can be made using various methods, including credit\/debit cards and P2P trading. Notably, for P2P trading purchases, only taker transactions will count towards the promotion. A 'taker' is someone who places an order that is immediately executed, effectively removing liquidity from the market. Users can expect the reward vouchers to be distributed within four weeks after the promotion ends, and they must be redeemed within two weeks from the date of distribution. Binance's Commitment and User Responsibility As with all trading and investment opportunities, Binance reminds users of the inherent risks involved in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The exchange emphasizes that investments should only be made with an understanding of these risks and within the capacity of potential losses. This promotion underscores Binance's commitment to providing value to its users and fostering engagement within the crypto ecosystem. As the Bitcoin Halving event draws near, activities such as this highlight the platform's innovative approach to user rewards and market participation. The Bitcoin Halving event is expected to draw significant attention from both the crypto community and potential investors, with Binance's reward campaign positioning itself as a strategic initiative amidst this pivotal market period.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced a significant upgrade to its VIP Investor Program. Effective from March 14, 2024, at 12:30 UTC, the exchange will merge its existing VIP Investor Programs for Simple Earn Locked Products and Dual Investment into a single, unified program. The upgraded program will also include subscription amounts from Simple Earn Flexible Products and ETH Staking. This move is designed to make it more convenient for users holding assets in multiple Earn products to qualify for VIP levels 1-4 and unlock more rewards as a Binance VIP. The VIP tiers will be determined based on a user's 30-day average earn subscription amount and daily average BNB holdings. Users meeting the specified requirements will be automatically upgraded to the corresponding VIP tier between 01:00 and 06:00 UTC the following day if the program qualifies them for a higher level than their current standing. The upgraded VIP Investor Program offers several benefits to users, including lower trading fees, customized limits, bespoke products, exclusive invitations to VIP gatherings and industry events, and dedicated support. The discounted fee structure is based on VIP levels, with higher levels offering greater discounts. Flexible trading limit configurations, such as spot and futures rate limits, increased API limits, withdrawals, and sub-accounts, are also available to VIP users. To participate in the VIP Investors Program, users must be verified on the Binance platform. The exchange will review users' 30-day average earn subscription amount and daily average BNB holdings on a daily basis, with VIP tier upgrades taking effect automatically between 01:00 and 06:00 UTC the following day. Binance clarified that WBETH holdings in the Earn wallet would be considered as part of users' subscription amount in ETH Staking. However, assets directly subscribed into Launchpads and\/or Launchpools will not count towards the calculation of users' 30-day average earn subscription amount. In the event that a user qualifies for a higher VIP level under another subprogram of the Binance VIP Program, the highest VIP level will apply. Users can visit the VIP Fee Structure or User Dashboard to confirm their current VIP level. Binance reserves the right to amend or terminate the VIP Investor Program at its sole discretion. The exchange also noted that there might be discrepancies in the translated versions of the original announcement in English, advising users to refer to the original version for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

        "articleSummary": "Authorities in Argentina have arrested a Brazilian couple accused of masterminding a $400 million cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme.",
        "creationDate": "2024-03-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Argentine Federal Police (PFA) have apprehended a Brazilian couple alleged to have orchestrated a Ponzi scheme involving over $400 million in cryptocurrencies. This operation, labeled \"Assim você me estafa,\" led to the duo's arrest in a country estate in Escobar, a district of Buenos Aires. The couple had been the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by INTERPOL for a year prior to their capture. They are accused of devising an elaborate Ponzi scheme, which amassed substantial sums from investors, lured by the promise of lucrative returns through cryptocurrency investments. The meticulous operation by the PFA was coordinated by their Division of Interpol after intense intelligence work that included tracking the suspects' expenditures in various establishments such as supermarkets and gyms. This trail led the authorities to the Haras Santa María country estate, approximately 50 kilometers from the Federal Capital, where the couple was residing under false identities. The news of this arrest brings to light the ongoing risks associated with the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. Ponzi schemes, named after the infamous swindler Charles Ponzi, are fraudulent investing scams that generate returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. This type of scheme leads to massive losses for most investors when the operation inevitably collapses. The arrest in Argentina underscores the commitment of international law enforcement agencies to combat financial crimes in the digital age. The collaborative efforts of the PFA and INTERPOL highlight the increasing scrutiny on cryptocurrency transactions, particularly those that may be linked to fraudulent activities. This event serves as a cautionary tale for investors in digital assets. Due diligence and skepticism are crucial when evaluating investment opportunities, particularly those promising exorbitant returns that seem too good to be true. The broader implications for the crypto market are significant. As authorities around the world tighten their grip on fraudulent crypto activities, legitimate operations and investors may face increased regulatory scrutiny. This could lead to more stringent compliance requirements for crypto platforms and could potentially deter new entrants to the market. Cryptocurrency has been lauded for its potential to democratize finance, but as this case illustrates, it also presents new challenges for law enforcement and investor protection. As the market matures, it is expected that both regulatory mechanisms and investor awareness will evolve to mitigate the risks of such fraudulent schemes. The couple's arrest not only represents a victory for the PFA and INTERPOL but also serves as a deterrent to would-be fraudsters. It highlights the increasing efficacy of international cooperation in the detection and apprehension of individuals attempting to exploit the crypto ecosystem for illicit gains. Authorities continue to alert investors to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activities in the crypto space. As the digital asset landscape grows, the need for investor education and regulatory oversight becomes ever more apparent. Image source: Shutterstock"

In addition to spot trading, Mox Bank also intends to introduce Bitcoin spot ETFs from the United States, further diversifying its crypto asset investment offerings. This move would position Mox Bank as one of the first virtual banks in Hong Kong to provide crypto ETF investment options. Mox Bank has been actively expanding its investment services. In late February, the bank launched the \"Mox Invest\" feature, enabling users to invest in US and Hong Kong stocks. Within a month of its launch, the service has attracted approximately 10,000 customers. Jayant Bhatia, Mox Bank's Head of Product, stated that the investment business would help the bank diversify its revenue streams.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, has officially announced the introduction of AEVO (AEVO) on its Binance Launchpool platform. This marks the 48th project to be featured on the Launchpool, signaling Binance's ongoing commitment to expanding its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and providing its users with new opportunities in the growing crypto space. AEVO is a decentralized derivatives exchange platform that utilizes blockchain technology to offer a secure and efficient trading environment. With a maximum token supply of 1 billion AEVO, the Launchpool aims to distribute 45 million AEVO tokens (4.5% of the max supply) as rewards to users who stake their BNB and FDUSD. The staking event is scheduled to commence on March 8, 2024, at 00:00 UTC and will run for five days, ending on March 12, 2024, at 23:59 UTC. Participants will have the opportunity to farm AEVO tokens by contributing to separate BNB and FDUSD pools, with respective reward allocations of 36 million AEVO (80%) and 9 million AEVO (20%). Binance plans to list AEVO on its exchange platform on March 13, 2024, at 10:00 UTC, with multiple trading pairs, including AEVO\/BTC, AEVO\/USDT, AEVO\/BNB, AEVO\/FDUSD, and AEVO\/TRY. The listing will enable broader access and liquidity to the AEVO token, following its initial farming period on the Launchpool. In preparation for the Launchpool event, Binance users are required to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and ensure that their country of residence is eligible for participation. Notably, residents of certain jurisdictions, including the USA, Canada, Japan, and several others, are restricted from participating in the AEVO farming due to local regulations. AEVO's introduction on the Binance Launchpool is a significant milestone for the platform and the DeFi sector. It reflects the growing interest and development in decentralized financial products and services that offer alternatives to traditional financial systems. AEVO's focus on derivatives trading positions it as a promising player in the DeFi space, aiming to enhance the trading experience with blockchain's inherent transparency and security. Binance encourages interested parties to read the AEVO research report, which provides an in-depth analysis of the project and its potential impact on the DeFi landscape. As with any investment in digital assets, Binance reminds users that the cryptocurrency market is subject to high risk and volatility. It is crucial for investors to conduct their research, consider their financial situation, and consult with financial advisors before participating in token farming or trading activities. The AEVO Launchpool event is part of Binance's broader initiative to support innovative blockchain projects and foster the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. Binance continues to play a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency industry, providing a platform for new projects to gain exposure and for users to engage with the latest developments in blockchain technology.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the world's leading digital asset exchange, has announced the removal of select margin trading pairs. The decision, slated to take effect on March 15, 2024, aligns with the exchange's continuous efforts to optimize its offerings and improve user experience. Binance Margin Trading Pairs Delisting The official notice, released on March 6, 2024, details the discontinuation of certain cross and isolated margin trading pairs.

Users are advised to proactively manage their positions, either by closing them or transferring funds to their Spot Wallets before the cessation of margin trading for these pairs to avoid potential losses. Binance has emphasized that it will not be responsible for any resulting losses. Market Implications and User Sentiment This move by Binance could reflect a strategic shift as the platform streamlines its services in response to market demands and risk management considerations. The delisting of margin trading pairs typically occurs due to low liquidity or trading volumes, regulatory considerations, or to enhance platform performance. The cryptocurrency community's reaction to the delisting has been mixed. Some traders express disappointment at losing leverage options for their preferred assets, while others appreciate the exchange's efforts to maintain a robust and efficient trading environment.

The exchange continues to advise traders to make informed decisions, bearing in mind their financial situation and risk tolerance.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-05",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has made a decisive move to cease all services related to the Nigerian Naira (NGN) on its platform. This announcement comes as a response to the changing regulatory environment and Binance's commitment to compliance and transparency in its operations. Timeline for Service Discontinuation The discontinuation of NGN services will follow a specific timeline, as outlined by Binance. The immediate call to action for users is to withdraw their NGN balances, trade their NGN assets, or convert their NGN into cryptocurrency before the services are fully phased out. Notably, from March 8, 2024, any remaining NGN balances will be converted into the stablecoin USDT, with Binance setting a fixed conversion rate based on the recent average closing prices of the USDT\/NGN trading pair. Final Dates for NGN Transactions Binance has set clear deadlines for its users: NGN deposits will cease from March 5, 2024, at 14:00 UTC. Withdrawals will not be supported after March 8, 2024, at 06:00 UTC. Conversion of NGN balances to USDT will begin on March 8, 2024, at 08:00 UTC, with the specified exchange rate of 1 USDT = 1,515.13 NGN. Impact on Trading Pairs and Other Services In line with this, Binance will delist all existing NGN spot trading pairs and remove NGN from Binance Convert. The platform's P2P service has already delisted NGN trading pairs, and Binance Pay will also remove NGN from its supported payment options. Users participating in Binance Auto-Invest plans with NGN will need to adjust their strategies accordingly. Pressure from Nigerian government Binance has been facing increased scrutiny from the Nigerian government due to allegations of terrorism financing, money laundering, and exchange rate manipulation. The Nigerian House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes has summoned Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to appear before the committee by March 4, 2024. The committee's Chair, Ginger Onwusibe, issued the ultimatum to address suspicions of the exchange's involvement in illicit financial activities. The committee has expressed its commitment to combating financial crimes and protecting Nigerian citizens from potential risks posed by foreign companies operating in the country. On March 1, 2024, Blockchain.News reported that the Nigerian government was seeking $10 billion in damages from Binance, alleging that the exchange had manipulated exchange rates, contributing to the Naira's 70% devaluation. The platform has also been accused of facilitating money laundering and terrorism financing. The Central Bank of Nigeria has reportedly detained two foreign executives and disclosed $26 billion in cryptocurrency trades. However, both the Nigerian government and Binance have since denied these allegations. In a statement, Binance clarified that it has not received any official communication from the Nigerian authorities regarding the alleged summons or the $10 billion damages claim. The exchange maintained that it operates in compliance with local laws and regulations and has a strong commitment to anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML\/CFT) measures. Binance's Commitment to the Crypto Ecosystem Despite these changes, Binance has expressed gratitude to its users for their continued support and assures that it remains dedicated to building a sustainable crypto ecosystem. The focus on transparency and growth within the regulatory frameworks is evident in Binance's approach to the discontinuation process. Advisory and Risk Warning Binance advises users to manage their assets accordingly and reminds them of the inherent volatility and risk associated with digital asset investments. The exchange encourages informed decision-making and, where necessary, consultation with financial advisors. Conclusion The halting of NGN services by Binance is a significant development for Nigerian users and reflects the broader challenges that crypto exchanges face in navigating global regulatory waters. As Binance and other platforms adapt to these changes, the crypto community will likely see an increased emphasis on compliance and risk management across the industry. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "In an inspiring twist of fate for cryptocurrency investors, Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, has reported a staggering success story of an early investor in the $PEPE token. This individual's initial investment of $3,000 has skyrocketed to an estimated value of $35.5 million, highlighting the extreme profit potential within the volatile crypto market. The investor purchased 4.9 trillion $PEPE tokens early on, at a time when the market was relatively unaware of its potential. His strategic moves and diamond hands have paid off as he sold 760 billion tokens for $2 million and still holds 4.15 trillion tokens worth approximately $30.8 million. This places him as the 13th largest holder of $PEPE. A Windfall Gain The total profit from the $PEPE investment is around $32.8 million, reflecting an extraordinary gain of 11,077 times the initial investment. Such returns are uncommon but not unheard of in the cryptocurrency world, where market dynamics can shift rapidly, often driven by technological advancements, investor sentiment, and market adoption. Market Sentiment and Performance The current sentiment around $PEPE is buzzing, as indicated by a recent tweet from Quicktick, a crypto analytics service. They noted that $PEPE is currently valued at $0.000007, experiencing a 37.09% increase over 24 hours and a 394.63% surge over seven days. The trading volume for $PEPE stands at $3.29 billion over the last 24 hours, and its market ranking is 40. When compared to Bitcoin, $PEPE has increased by 31.84% in the last 24 hours. The Larger Picture This investor's story exemplifies the transformative impact blockchain technology and cryptocurrency can have on individual wealth. It also underscores the importance of market research, timing, and the potential benefits of early adoption in the crypto space. However, it is vital for investors to approach such markets with caution, as the risk of loss is as significant as the potential for gain. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means that while some see windfall profits, others may face substantial losses. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has issued a warning to the public about the cryptocurrency exchange Bitforex, citing suspected virtual asset-related fraud. The warning comes amidst growing concerns over the exchange's operations and its ability to process user withdrawals. According to the SFC's statement, Bitforex is not licensed or registered to offer any regulated activities in Hong Kong. The regulator has received multiple complaints from investors who have been unable to withdraw their funds from the platform, raising suspicions of fraudulent activity. The SFC's warning follows recent findings by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who reported that Bitforex's hot wallets saw outflows of approximately $56.5 million on February 23. Shortly after the significant outflows, users began experiencing issues with withdrawals, which have remained unprocessed with no official announcements from the exchange. The lack of communication from Bitforex has led to increased uncertainty among its user base, with many taking to social media platforms to demand answers and express concerns about the safety of their funds. The exchange's CEO stepped down from their position just one month prior to the current issues, further compounding the growing apprehension surrounding the platform. Bitforex holds significant portions of the TRB (Tellor) and OMI (ECOMI) token supplies. The exchange's wallets are being closely monitored by the crypto community for any additional suspicious activity. The SFC's warning serves as a reminder of the risks associated with unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges and the importance of conducting thorough due diligence before investing in virtual assets. The regulator urges investors to exercise caution and only deal with licensed or registered entities when engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities. The SFC encourages anyone who has invested in Bitforex or has been affected by the exchange's suspected fraudulent activities to contact the regulator and provide relevant information to assist in their investigation. The ongoing situation at Bitforex highlights the need for increased regulatory oversight in cryptocurrency exchanges. As more investors enter the market, it is crucial for authorities to take proactive measures to protect consumers and prevent fraudulent activities. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Bitcoin has seen massive inflows into accumulation addresses, signalling record high demand according to on-chain analyst Julio Moreno. However, some indicators also suggest the Bitcoin market is in an overheated phase. Accumulation addresses are wallets that only receive BTC and never spend - indicating investors are buying and holding Bitcoin. According to Moreno, inflows into these accumulation addresses have reached record highs, showing extremely strong demand for Bitcoin. However, Moreno also warned that prices have increased so quickly that some indicators are beginning to signal an overheated bull market. The Bitcoin bull-bear market cycle indicator has flagged that the market is in an overheated bull phase, as prices reached $60,000. In addition, Bitcoin miners are being overpaid at current price levels based on the Bitcoin mining hash ribbon indicator. Miners receive block rewards and transaction fees for securing the network, but higher Bitcoin prices result in very high rewards. The mining hash ribbon being in the \"overheated\" zone suggests unsustainably high miner income, which could lead to selling pressure. Moreover, traders' unrealized profit margins are very elevated at 45%, also indicating risks of traders selling to take profits if prices stop rising. While on-chain data shows strong accumulating demand, short-term indicators reflect market conditions may be overextended. The rapid price increase of Bitcoin in 2021 has led to frothy conditions, though the long-term bullish case remains intact with investors steadily accumulating Bitcoin and holding.

        "creationDate": "2024-03-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Nigerian government is seeking a staggering $10 billion in damages from the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange platform, Binance, over accusations that its activities have significantly destabilized the country's economy, according to BBC. The claim centers around allegations that Binance has been a key player in manipulating the exchange rates, contributing to the Naira's nearly 70% devaluation in recent months. Bayo Onanuga, a spokesperson for President Bola Tinubu, emphasized the detrimental impact of Binance's operations on Nigeria's attempts to stabilize its economy. According to Onanuga, \"The platform is fixing the exchange rate in the country at an illegal rate. The CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) is the only authority that can set exchange rates in the country.\" Furthermore, security agencies have detained two foreign executives of Binance as part of an ongoing investigation into the platform's alleged involvement in money laundering and terrorism financing. The Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Olayemi Cardoso disclosed that approximately $26 billion has been transacted through Binance Nigeria in cryptocurrency trades, many of which stemmed from \"sources and users we cannot adequately identify,\" underscoring the regulatory challenges posed by cryptocurrencies. The Nigerian authorities assert that, contrary to the country's laws, Binance and other cryptocurrency companies have been operating without proper registration. Even after the CBN lifted a ban on cryptocurrency in 2023, compliance with registration requirements under the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) remained a contentious issue. Binance has since removed Naira transactions from its platforms as part of its cooperation with the government. Onanuga noted that the government's demands are not excessive given the rapid and severe economic disruptions attributed to Binance's activities. As the investigation proceeds, details on the duration it will take and the nature of discussions between the Nigerian government and Binance remain undisclosed. The situation has sparked broader discussions on the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges and the impact of decentralized financial platforms on national economies. This case has far-reaching implications for the crypto industry, especially in terms of regulatory compliance and the relationship between digital currency platforms and sovereign monetary policies. It also raises critical questions about the balance between innovation in the financial sector and the need for governments to safeguard their economies. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-03-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is set to introduce the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF to Brazilian investors in a groundbreaking move that brings cryptocurrency further into the traditional financial system. The ETF, which mirrors the one launched in the United States in January, will be made available in Brazil through a partnership with B3, the country's main stock exchange operator. Trading under the ticker IBT39 on the B3, this ETF is BlackRock's first crypto-based fund in Brazil and is available for trading starting from April 1st. It is designed to track the performance of Bitcoin and will be accessible to both qualified and retail investors, the company announced in a statement to Portal do Bitcoin. The ETF comes with an administrative fee of 0.25%, with a promotional one-year discount to 0.12% over the first $5 billion in assets under management (AUM). BlackRock's ETF in Brazil is structured as a Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDR), which are certificates representing shares issued by companies outside of Brazil but traded on the Brazilian market. Despite being subject to similar taxation as equities, BDRs do not enjoy any tax exemption, such as the one available for equity sales below R$ 20,000 per month on the stock exchange. This launch comes at a time when Bitcoin has registered a significant monthly gain, increasing 43% in February, the highest in four years. Karina Saade, BlackRock's country head in Brazil, emphasized the firm's commitment to providing high-quality digital asset vehicles to investors. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBT39) represents a natural progression of BlackRock's many years of effort in the digital asset market and builds upon the fundamental capabilities established thus far. Felipe Gonçalves, Head of Products for Interest Rates and Currencies at B3, highlighted the growing interest in the crypto market from investors worldwide and the demand for such options in the Brazilian capital market. B3 is dedicated to offering products that meet this demand while ensuring the security of operating on the exchange, Gonçalves concluded. This strategic move by BlackRock and B3 signifies a notable step towards integrating digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios in Brazil and represents a growing trend of traditional financial institutions embracing cryptocurrencies.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT), a trailblazer in vertically integrated Bitcoin mining, has taken a significant step to amplify its mining operations. The company has announced a substantial investment in a new batch of mining hardware, purchasing 31,500 WhatsMiner M60S miners from the distinguished manufacturer MicroBT for a total of $97.4 million. This strategic acquisition is set to replace less efficient miners and add considerable hash rate capacity at Riot's flagship Rockdale Facility. Expanding Hash Rate Capacity The purchase comes at a cost of approximately $16.50 per terahash (TH), reflecting the focus on enhancing operational efficiency and the overall hash rate. The 31,500 miners boast a combined total of 5.9 exahash per second (EH\/s), which significantly contributes to the company's ambitious goals. Riot's foresight in hash rate growth is evident as it expects to reach a target of 31 EH\/s by the end of 2024, incorporating expansion at both the Rockdale and the forthcoming Corsicana facilities. Deployment and Operational Impact Scheduled to be delivered in May and June 2024, the new miners will increase the Rockdale Facility's self-mining hash rate from its current 12.4 EH\/s to an estimated 15.1 EH\/s by the end of July 2024. Approximately 14,500 miners will be added to the Rockdale Facility's capacity, and around 17,000 will replace existing underperforming hardware. The M60S miners are MicroBT's latest generation air-cooled machines, each offering an efficiency of 18.5 joules per TH and an output of approximately 186 TH\/s. This upgrade is anticipated to result in enhanced operating uptime and energy efficiency, as these units are noted as the most efficient produced by MicroBT to date. Riot reported a significant operational growth in 2023, with a total revenue of $280.7 million, up from $259.2 million in 2022, according to Blockchain.News. The company saw a 19% increase in Bitcoin production, with 6,626 Bitcoin mined. Riot's strategic power strategy earned $71.2 million in power credits during supply\/demand issues. The company expanded its Rockdale Facility and Corsicana Facility, aiming to become the world's largest dedicated Bitcoin mining facility. Riot's financial health was strong, with a strong balance sheet and a 33% decrease in Bitcoin mining costs. CEO Perspectives Riot's CEO, Jason Les, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition: \"This order not only increases our hash rate but also significantly improves our operational efficiency.\" Les further added that the investment underscores Riot's commitment to becoming a leading low-cost Bitcoin miner and enhancing its industry-leading fleet.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-25",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has cast a spotlight on a grim nexus of cryptocurrency and human trafficking in Southeast Asia through its recent analysis. In a comprehensive report, Chainalysis details how 'pig butchering' scam gangs operate in lawless regions, exploiting both victims of romance scams and trafficked individuals forced to perpetrate these crimes. The report, titled \"The On-chain Footprint of Southeast Asia\u2019s \u2018Pig Butchering\u2019 Compounds: Human Trafficking, Ransoms, and Hundreds of Millions Scammed,\" provides an in-depth look at the operations of these criminal organizations. It emphasizes the staggering $700 million lost to romance scams in 2022, according to the FBI's IC3 Report, and nearly $2.5 billion lost to various types of crypto investment scams. These 'pig butchering' scams, a term derived from the tactic of 'fattening up' victims before fraudulently extracting their funds, often begin with romantic overtures on social media or text messages. Victims are lured with the promise of love or companionship and are eventually persuaded to invest in fraudulent schemes. The scams are not just a threat to financial security but also pose a significant human rights issue. Many of the scam operators are victims themselves, trafficked and forced to work under inhumane conditions in large compounds such as the infamous KK Park in Myanmar's Myawaddy. Chainalysis' analysis sheds light on the complex web of transactions linking ransom payments for trafficked individuals to the proceeds from romance scams. The report includes a case study of KK Park, revealing how two ransom addresses are connected to known scam wallets, indicating the scale of operations within these compounds. The cryptocurrency community is responding to the crisis, with significant interventions from organizations like Tether and OKX, who have aided in freezing assets linked to human trafficking. Moreover, a collaboration between the US Department of Justice and these cryptocurrency platforms led to a substantial seizure of assets tied to these crimes. Efforts to dismantle these operations are ongoing, with law enforcement agencies across the globe stepping up their efforts. In late 2023, an Interpol operation spearheaded by South Korea resulted in the arrest of 3,500 cyber criminals and the confiscation of $300 million in assets, including a substantial amount in cryptocurrencies. Chainalysis calls for increased vigilance within the cryptocurrency sector, urging businesses to be proactive in identifying and reporting suspicious activities to the authorities. The intersection of cryptocurrency and crime elucidates the need for robust regulation and cooperation between blockchain companies, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-25",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Recent data suggest that Canadian holders of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are moving their investments, with substantial outflows recorded from the Purpose Bitcoin ETF. Purpose Bitcoin ETF Sees Significant Outflows The Purpose Bitcoin ETF, a pioneering product in the Canadian market, has seen noticeable drawdowns in its Bitcoin holdings. According to a tweet from HODL15Capital, the ETF sold 199 BTC yesterday and a total of 604 BTC over the last week. Since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF has reduced its holdings by nearly 5,000 BTC. Comparative Fees and Investor Sentiment Investor sentiment could be influenced by the comparative fee structures between Canadian and US ETFs. HODL15Capital highlighted that the Purpose Bitcoin ETF's fee of 1.5% is relatively high compared to its US counterparts and even other Canadian options such as the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, which has a fee of 1%. This cost difference may be a driving factor for the migration of assets. CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Also Experiences Outflows The CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF has not been immune to this trend, experiencing its own set of outflows. The data indicates a decrease from 7,233 BTC held in early January to 6,737 BTC currently. Market Dynamics and Investor Choices These outflows could be indicative of larger market dynamics at play. Some industry commentators suggest that the assets from these Canadian ETFs are likely moving to US ETFs, although there is no definitive way to confirm this. The shift could be attributed to investors seeking more competitive fee structures or differing perceptions of regulatory environments between the US and Canada. The movement of capital from Canadian to US Bitcoin ETFs is a significant development in the cryptocurrency space. It reflects not only the competitive nature of financial products but also the evolving preferences and strategies of crypto investors. As the market continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see further shifts in how and where investors choose to park their crypto assets. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-24",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Airdropped tokens, often seen as a windfall for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, come with the strategic dilemma of the best time to sell for maximum gains. CoinGecko, an aggregator of cryptocurrency data, has recently published an insightful study that could serve as a significant guidepost for airdrop recipients. When to Cash in on Airdrops? According to CoinGecko's analysis, nearly half of the major airdrops recorded peak token prices within a fortnight of their distribution date. Specifically, 23 out of the 50 biggest airdrops saw their value skyrocket shortly after release, suggesting that early selling might be the key to profit maximization. Noteworthy examples include Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and X2Y2, which showed impressive gains of 73% and 121% respectively by just the second day of trading. On the other hand, airdrops such as Blur, LooksRare, and ArbDoge AI also demonstrated substantial profitability in the short term. Yearly Market Conditions: A Deciding Factor The CoinGecko analysis further broke down the airdrop performance across different market conditions, providing a nuanced view of the crypto-landscape. The 2021 Bull Market During the 2021 bull run, 38% of airdrop tokens reached their all-time highs (ATHs), underscoring the influence of overall market trends on token valuations. For instance, Uniswap's ATH price return of 1,145% was a staggering tenfold increase over its highest returns in the initial two weeks of trading. The 2022 Bear Market Conversely, in 2022's bearish climate, the study indicated that immediate selling post-airdrop was generally more advantageous, particularly for non-NFT tokens. This shift showcases the market's volatility and the need for airdrop recipients to stay attuned to the broader economic environment. The Return of Bullish Sentiment in 2023 and 2024 The analysis pointed to a resurgence of bullish sentiment in the following years, with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US contributing to this optimism. Tokens such as Arbitrum (ARB) and Bonk (BONK) showed that holding onto airdrops for an extended period could lead to substantial gains. Airdrop Profit Dynamics The CoinGecko study spans four years of data and indicates the diverse outcomes of airdrop profits. While some tokens peak immediately, others accrue value over time, often aligning with the project's developmental milestones and market conditions. Airdrop Gains at Peak Prices: A Closer Look Here are some notable airdrop tokens and their percentage price returns at peak: Bonk: 28,092% after 51 weeks Arbitrum: 68% after 43 weeks Uniswap (UNI): 1,145% after 33 weeks Optimism (OP): 186% after 1.6 years Methodological Rigor CoinGecko's methodology involved collecting price data from January 1, 2020, to February 20, 2024, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of airdrop performance. Strategic Implications for Investors For those holding airdropped tokens, strategic selling is vital. While quick profits are tempting, the data suggests that market conditions, project growth, sentiment, and patience can be more lucrative in the long run. Final Thoughts The insights from CoinGecko's meticulous research offer valuable guidance for navigating the intricate timing of airdrop token sales. For the evolving cryptocurrency market, adaptive learning and strategic planning remain crucial for investors aiming to maximize their returns. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Crypto exchange Kraken has filed a motion seeking to dismiss a lawsuit brought forth by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that the agency is setting a dangerous precedent that could potentially give it unfettered authority over vast swathes of commerce. This legal battle marks yet another chapter in the ongoing scrutiny of cryptocurrency entities by regulatory bodies. Background on the Case The SEC has taken various crypto businesses to court, alleging violations of securities laws. The case against Kraken specifically centers on the SEC's claim that the exchange has been involved in offering unregistered securities to its customers. Kraken counters this by suggesting that the SEC's stance implies that once a sale is complete, there should be no ongoing obligations or interactions between issuer and purchaser\u2014a theory that Kraken believes could lead to unlimited regulatory authority for the SEC. Implications for the Crypto Industry If the SEC were to succeed in its lawsuit against Kraken, it could set a precedent affecting the entire crypto industry. Potentially, any transaction could be scrutinized under the guise of securities law, leading to a chilling effect on innovation and commerce within the sector. This case is being closely watched by industry participants as it could influence future regulatory frameworks and enforcement actions. Analysis of Kraken's Position Kraken's defense hinges on the principle that not all crypto assets are securities and that the SEC's broad application of securities laws is inappropriate. The exchange emphasizes the need for clear regulation that distinguishes between different types of crypto assets and their uses. Historical Context This isn't the first time a crypto company has faced regulatory challenges. Previously, Ripple Labs Inc. has been embroiled in a similar lawsuit with the SEC, which has yet to be resolved. The outcomes of these cases could heavily influence the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States. As this legal confrontation unfolds, the crypto community and regulatory observers await the court's decision on Kraken's motion to dismiss. The outcome will likely impact not just Kraken but the entire cryptocurrency industry and its operations within the U.S. market. Image source: Shutterstock"

The exchange cited lack of transparency into Velo\u2019s business activities and failure to comply with previous improvement requests as reasons for the designation. Deposits of VELO will be suspended starting at 4PM KST on February 22. Bithumb will decide whether to extend the cautionary designation in early March. During the designation period, Velo Protocol will have the opportunity to resolve the cited issues and request removal of the cautionary status. Bithumb instituted its investment cautionary designation policy to protect investors by providing warnings about potentially concerning cryptocurrencies offered on its platform. Cryptocurrencies can be designated cautionary for reasons including lack of transparency, rumors of misconduct, technical vulnerabilities, and regulatory noncompliance. According to Bithumb\u2019s notice, the exchange has been unable to verify details of Velo\u2019s business activities and development progress. Additionally, Velo allegedly failed to comply with all provisions of a previous improvement request. Bithumb now considers additional investor protections necessary. Velo Protocol, developed by Velo Labs, issues VELO tokens on the Stellar blockchain. The Velo Protocol ecosystem aims to facilitate fast, affordable, and secure transactions. The protocol connects traditional financial partners and cryptocurrency providers to enhance liquidity and interoperability. Bithumb stated its commitment to sustainable and systematic oversight of listed cryptocurrencies.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Imagine stepping into the vibrant world of financial markets, where the buzz of trading floors has been replaced with the digital hum of servers executing trades in milliseconds. At the heart of this transformation lies the concept of cryptocurrency futures trading, a realm that merges the pioneering spirit of digital currencies with the age-old practice of futures trading. This innovative fusion allows traders to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies without the need to hold the actual digital coins, offering a new layer of strategic depth and risk management to the digital trading experience. How Blockchain Is Revolutionizing Commodity Markets Blockchain, the technology underpinning most cryptocurrencies, is not just reshaping the landscape of digital currencies but also redefining the commodity trading market. Through its ability to enhance transparency, ensure security and eliminate unnecessary intermediaries, blockchain is making commodity trading more accessible and streamlined. For example, the use of smart contracts automates transactions and enforces the agreement's terms, reducing the likelihood of fraud and errors. This technological advancement brings a breath of fresh air to traditional commodity markets, injecting efficiency and trust where it's most needed. The Synergy Between Traditional Finance and Cryptocurrencies In an unexpected twist, the financial world is witnessing a convergence between traditional financial instruments and digital currencies. Platforms that once exclusively catered to stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, options and indices are now opening their gates to cryptocurrencies. This integration speaks volumes about the growing acceptance and maturity of digital currencies in the eyes of traditional investors. As regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate these new assets, the line between conventional and digital finance blurs, paving the way for a future where both can coexist and complement each other. Embracing Digital Platforms for Agricultural Commodity Trading The agricultural sector, with its deep-rooted traditions, might seem worlds apart from the high-tech arenas of digital trading. Yet, digital platforms are making significant inroads into this market, offering farmers and investors alike a new venue for trading agricultural commodities. The allure of global market access, combined with the liquidity and efficiency offered by digital platforms, is hard to resist. However, these platforms also come with their own set of challenges, such as the risk of market volatility. Thankfully, modern technology, including blockchain and data analytics, is helping to mitigate these risks, making digital platforms an increasingly viable option for agricultural commodity trading. The fusion of traditional and digital trading realms offers exciting possibilities as the world of financial markets continues to evolve. The journey into cryptocurrency futures trading and the broader adoption of blockchain across various markets are just the beginning. As technology progresses, so too will the opportunities for traders and investors, opening up new horizons in the ever-changing landscape of global finance. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-22",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Market Resilience Emerges from Trials In an analysis dated February 20, 2024, Pantera Capital reflected on the cryptocurrency market's resilience following a period marked by unprecedented challenges. The firm, led by CEO Dan Morehead, highlighted a significant shift from a tumultuous phase characterized by \"rare, crazy bad things\" to a climate with an \"absence of bad things,\" which is now fostering market recovery. The year 2022 was particularly brutal for investors, with U.S. bond markets experiencing their worst year and IPO proceeds plummeting by 95% from the preceding year, as per the analysis by Edward McQuarrie. Bitcoin's Potential Beyond Perception Shifting the focus to Bitcoin, the letter underscored the cryptocurrency's overlooked potential for programmability and its capability to foster decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With a market capitalization 60% larger than Visa's and daily trading volumes 250% more than Apple's, Bitcoin's global influence is undeniable. Despite this, traditional financial institutions have largely neglected Bitcoin's technological aspects for a decade. The Pantera team posits that Bitcoin's \"digital Fort Knox\" status and its vast computational power backstop could lead to a foundational role in a DeFi system that currently remains untapped. Institutional Adoption and Positive Regulation Pantera's letter noted increased institutional adoption, further propelled by regulatory clarity and the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier in the year. The report also alluded to favorable rulings in high-profile cases, such as Ripple's XRP not being classified as a security and Grayscale's victory against the SEC over its Bitcoin ETF application. These developments are seen as harbingers of a regulatory environment that is becoming more conducive to innovation within the United States. Technological Advancements and Market Outlook The discussion also touched on the technological advancements within the blockchain ecosystem, particularly the growth of Ethereum layer 2s and hyperscale blockchains. Pantera anticipates these developments to be the \"dial-up\" to \"broadband\" moment for blockchain, potentially catalyzing a wave of new applications and use cases. Looking ahead, the firm positions the upcoming Bitcoin halving in late April 2024 as a potential catalyst for a strong bull market, aligning with historical patterns of increased demand and reduced new bitcoin supply impacting prices.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-21",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In today's digital age, cryptocurrency has taken center stage, intriguing enthusiasts and investors alike with its potential for significant returns. It all begins with a simple decision to buy Bitcoin and dive into this novel financial landscape. As pivotal players in the digital finance ecosystem, cryptocurrency exchanges offer a gateway to a world where digital assets can be exchanged with ease and security. They have evolved to become more than just transactional platforms, providing a wide array of services and investment opportunities for users around the globe. Unraveling the Mysteries of Secure Transactions in the Crypto World The cornerstone of any cryptocurrency exchange is the security of transactions. In an era where digital threats loom large, ensuring that each transaction is secure is not just important\u2014it's essential. This is achieved through advanced technologies like blockchain and sophisticated encryption methods, which together provide a robust defense against potential breaches. Choosing the right exchange, therefore, becomes a matter of assessing these security features critically. Additionally, users have a role to play in securing their assets, from setting strong passwords to enabling two-factor authentication, all of which safeguard one's investment in this digital treasure trove. With the proliferation of digital assets, the need for ironclad security protocols in cryptocurrency exchanges has never been higher. These platforms harness cutting-edge technology, not only to thwart unauthorized access but also to foster an environment of trust where users can trade with confidence. They employ a multi-tiered security approach, which includes cold storage for funds, insurance-backed assets and regular security audits, to stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities. As a result, users are encouraged to navigate this burgeoning market, fortified with the knowledge that their transactions are shielded by some of the most sophisticated security measures available today. The Evolution of Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Past, Present and Future The journey of cryptocurrency exchanges from their inception to the multifaceted platforms of today is nothing short of remarkable. Initially, these platforms were rudimentary, focusing merely on the buying and selling of a few digital currencies. Fast forward to the present, and they resemble advanced financial hubs offering a gamut of services including futures trading, staking and even savings accounts in cryptocurrencies. The future holds even more promise with potential integrations of artificial intelligence and machine learning, aimed at enhancing user experience, improving security measures and perhaps even personalizing investment strategies for users. From their nascent stages to the current state-of-the-art platforms, cryptocurrency exchanges have come a long way. The next revolution in their evolution seems poised to merge the realms of traditional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi), creating hybrid models that could potentially offer the best of both worlds. These future iterations may incorporate additional layers of financial services, such as smart contracts that execute automatically under predefined conditions, expanding the functionality and flexibility of cryptocurrency investments. As we stand on the cusp of these advancements, it's clear that the evolution of cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to shape the financial landscape in unprecedented ways. How Digital Asset Platforms Are Revolutionizing Investment Opportunities Cryptocurrency exchanges have significantly broadened the scope of investment opportunities, democratizing access to global financial markets. No longer are investments in diverse assets limited to those with deep pockets or insider knowledge. These platforms have introduced a variety of innovative products, from tokenized versions of traditional stocks to unique digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), making investment opportunities accessible to everyone. This democratization of finance is not just a trend but a movement towards a more inclusive financial ecosystem that empowers individuals worldwide. Understanding the Importance of User Experience in Crypto Trading Platforms A seamless user experience is pivotal in attracting and retaining participants in the bustling world of cryptocurrency trading. An intuitive interface allows users to navigate through complex transactions with ease, making the platform accessible to both seasoned traders and novices. Moreover, the availability of educational resources within these platforms plays a critical role in user empowerment, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Robust support systems further enhance the user experience, ensuring that assistance is readily available whenever needed, thereby building trust and reliability among the user base. The Journey of a Crypto Transaction: From Initiation to Completion The initiation of a cryptocurrency transaction, perhaps starting from a simple intention to buy Bitcoin, sets off a complex process that underscores the technological marvel of digital currencies. Once a transaction is initiated, it enters a network where it gets verified through a consensus mechanism, ensuring its security and legitimacy. This journey, from initiation to the final validation, is not just a testament to the robustness of blockchain technology but also to the seamless integration of these processes by cryptocurrency exchanges to provide a smooth experience for the user. Completion of the transaction signifies not just the transfer of assets but the intricate dance of technology and trust that makes it all possible. In conclusion, the realm of cryptocurrency exchanges and investments is one filled with opportunities and innovations. From the secure and seamless execution of transactions to the broadening of investment horizons and the enhancement of user experiences, these platforms are at the forefront of the digital finance revolution. As we venture further into this exciting landscape, the potential for growth and transformation within the world of cryptocurrency remains boundless. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has issued a new circular detailing the regulatory standards authorized institutions must adhere to when selling and distributing tokenized products (cryptocurrency, virtual asset) to clients. This move marks a significant step in the regulatory body's efforts to embrace technological advancements in the financial sector while ensuring consumer and investor protection. Tokenized products, as defined by the HKMA in this circular, refer to real-world assets digitally represented using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technologies. The scope of this circular does not extend to tokenized products that are regulated under the Securities and Futures Ordinance or those subject to the regulations and guidelines issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the HKMA. The HKMA has expressed its support for the industry's initiatives in the realm of tokenization, acknowledging the progress made thus far. The regulatory standards outlined in the circular are aimed at providing clear guidelines for the banking sector to foster innovation in tokenization while implementing appropriate measures to safeguard consumers and investors. Key aspects covered in the circular include general principles that existing regulatory requirements and consumer\/investor protection measures applicable to the sale and distribution of a product also apply when the product is sold and distributed in a tokenized form. This is because the terms, features, and risks associated with the tokenized products (excluding risks specifically arising from tokenization) are similar to those of related products. Specific examples provided in the circular include the distribution of tokenized structured investment products not regulated under the Securities and Futures Ordinance and tokenized gold, which should follow the same regulatory requirements and investor protection measures as their non-tokenized counterparts. The HKMA's circular also emphasizes the need for authorized institutions to perform due diligence, disclose risks and product features transparently, and manage risks associated with the sale and distribution of tokenized products effectively. Institutions are expected to establish sufficient systems and control measures to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and to implement appropriate internal control measures to address the specific risks and unique nature of tokenized products. The circular represents a proactive approach by the HKMA to regulate emerging technologies in the financial sector, ensuring that the benefits of innovation are realized in a manner that protects consumers and maintains the integrity of the financial system. Authorized institutions with queries regarding the circular are encouraged to contact designated HKMA representatives for further guidance. The HKMA will continue to monitor the regulatory environment and global developments in the tokenization market, providing further guidance to authorized institutions as necessary.

        "articleSummary": "Researchers use AI to analyze emoji sentiment in cryptocurrency markets, providing insights into market dynamics and suggesting incorporating it into trading strategies to avoid market downturns.",
        "creationDate": "2024-02-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a research paper titled \"Emoji Driven Crypto Assets Market Reactions,\" a team of international researchers has shed light on the significant role played by emojis in influencing cryptocurrency markets. Led by Xiaorui Zuo from Fudan University in China, Yao-Tsung Chen from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan, and Wolfgang Karl Härdle from Humboldt University in Germany, the study explores the correlation between emoji sentiment and key market indicators, such as BTC price and the VCRIX index. The increasing influence of social media platforms, particularly Twitter, in shaping market trends and investor sentiments within the cryptocurrency realm has been widely recognized. However, the role of visual elements, specifically emojis, has remained relatively unexplored. This research aims to bridge this gap by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence-driven analyses to decode and quantify the sentiments expressed through emojis. The study employs state-of-the-art tools such as GPT-4 and a fine-tuned transformer-based BERT model for multimodal sentiment analysis. Emojis, being a universal language transcending linguistic barriers, offer a unique means of expression, encapsulating emotions and reactions that might be absent or ambiguous in text alone. By translating emojis into quantifiable sentiment data, the researchers are able to uncover valuable insights into market dynamics. The findings of the study suggest that strategies based on emoji sentiment can contribute to the avoidance of significant market downturns and stabilize returns. By integrating advanced AI-driven analyses into financial strategies, a more nuanced perspective on the interplay between digital communication and market dynamics can be achieved. This research highlights the practical benefits of incorporating emoji sentiment analysis into trading strategies, enabling market participants to identify and forecast trends more accurately. To achieve their results, the researchers developed an innovative approach that combines textual data with the expressive power of visual content, specifically emojis. They utilized the GPT4 toolset to transform the visual representation of emojis into descriptive text, which was then synthesized with corresponding Twitter text to create an enriched dataset. The application of Bert embeddings enhanced with a transformer layer enables the extraction of embedded sentiments within these emoji-augmented texts. The research team's methodology also involved correlating the sentiment analysis derived from these embeddings with cryptocurrency secondary market trends, using BTC prices and the VCRIX index as benchmarks. This comprehensive approach provides a more accurate depiction of market sentiments, offering insights that can contribute to better market prediction and analysis strategies. This study represents a significant step forward in understanding the interplay between social media expressions and cryptocurrency market movements. It underlines the importance of considering both textual and visual elements in sentiment analysis and lays the foundation for further research in the field. By embracing the power of emojis as an integral part of digital communication, market participants can gain a competitive edge in navigating the dynamic crypto landscape. The research was supported by the IDA Digital Asset Institute, ASE, Bucharest, and received additional funding from the Czech Science Foundation and the Yushan Fellowship. The detailed methodology, results, and implications of the study can be found in the published research paper, offering a valuable resource for academics, industry professionals, and investors interested in the intersection of cryptocurrency, social media, and market dynamics.

The MSS highlighted that this activity is particularly concerning when it involves targeted areas, offering high rewards for their data, and thus attracting collectors to these sensitive locations. The MSS's concern stems from the increasing use of advanced technologies such as big data, which, while improving navigation precision and convenience in daily commutes, also raises the risk of sensitive information leaks. This unauthorized data collection poses a significant threat to national security, as the leaked information, including traffic networks, important infrastructure, and military facilities, could be technically analyzed and processed by foreign entities. The statement further emphasized the integral role of geographical spatial information data in economic and social development, and the danger it poses once sensitive information is leaked. To counteract this threat, the Chinese national security authorities, in cooperation with relevant departments, are taking measures against both domestic and foreign individuals and enterprises involved in the illegal collection and smuggling of China's sensitive geographical spatial information data. The aim is to prevent the illegal outflow of such data and mitigate the risks associated with data leaks. Moreover, the MSS clarified that collecting and transmitting geographical spatial information data across borders without the necessary qualifications for mapping services in China might violate various Chinese laws, including the Counter-Espionage Law, the Surveying and Mapping Law, and the Data Security Law. The statement underscores the close link between geographical spatial information data and national security, highlighting the actions being taken to safeguard China's sovereignty, security, and developmental interests from unauthorized and illegal data collection activities by foreign companies and individuals lacking the proper mapping qualifications within China.

        "articleSummary": "Honduras' CNBS regulator bans cryptocurrency transactions within financial institutions due to fraud, money laundering, and regulatory inability to regulate multi-jurisdictional digital platforms amid global debate.",
        "creationDate": "2024-02-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBS) of Honduras has just placed a prohibition on the country's financial system participating in bitcoin and associated virtual asset transactions. This restriction was recently put into effect. Financial institutions that fall under the supervision of the Central National Bank of Honduras (CNBS) are prohibited from maintaining, investing, intermediating, or trading in cryptocurrencies, crypto-assets, virtual currencies, tokens, or any other similar virtual assets that have not been issued or authorized by the Central Bank of Honduras. This resolution went into effect immediately upon its announcement. The worries over the possible hazards of fraud, money laundering, and terrorist funding that are linked with cryptocurrency platforms, many of which operate across many countries that are outside the reach of Honduran law, were the driving force for this move. These platforms have remained active despite the fact that there is no legislation in place within the nation that governs crypto assets. This presents a substantial challenge to the legal and financial regulatory frameworks that are in place within the country. It is interesting to note that Honduras does not have any laws that regulate cryptocurrencies or virtual assets at the present time. This is similar to the situation in many other Central American nations, with the exception of Mexico, which has introduced special legislation regarding fintech and bitcoin. The Central Bank of Honduras has previously declared in 2018 that cryptocurrencies are not supported by the bank, and as a result, they are neither regulated or guaranteed for usage inside the nation. There is a striking contrast between this lack of legal protection and other payment systems, which are supported and regulated by the Central Bank. Given these restrictions and the larger context of cryptocurrency legality and regulation in Honduras, it is clear that the government is adopting a cautious approach to the incorporation of digital currencies into its financial system. This is obvious in the fact that the country is taking a cautious approach. This position represents a prevalent trend among numerous countries throughout the world, which is to assess the creative potential of cryptocurrencies against the hazards that they offer to existing financial and legal regimes.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its decision to discontinue support for Binance Leveraged Tokens (BLT). As part of its ongoing product review process, aimed at concentrating on offerings that deliver the most value and competitive services to its users, Binance has decided to halt trading and subscription services for all its leveraged tokens by the end of February 2024. This move underscores the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency exchanges, constantly evolving to meet user demands and regulatory standards. Key Details of the Announcement Trading and Subscription Cessation: Trading and subscription services for all Binance Leveraged Tokens will be suspended starting 2024-02-28 at 06:00 (UTC). Delisting and Redemption Cessation: Following the suspension, the tokens will be delisted, and redemption services will cease as per the schedule detailed for each leveraged token pair, culminating on 2024-04-03 at 06:00 (UTC) for certain tokens. Affected Leveraged Token Pairs: The tokens targeted for cessation include popular pairs like BNBUP\/USDT, BNBDOWN\/USDT, ETHUP\/USDT, ETHDOWN\/USDT, BTCUP\/USDT, and BTCDOWN\/USDT. Final Token Conversion: Post-delisting, any remaining leveraged tokens held by users will be converted to USDT based on their net asset value (NAV) at the time of delisting. The USDT will then be distributed to the users' accounts within 24 hours of the delisting process completion. Implications for Traders This decision impacts traders who utilize leveraged tokens for short-term trading strategies. Leveraged tokens, which represent a basket of perpetual contract positions, offer traders exposure to leverage while mitigating some of the risks associated with liquidation. However, they are also subject to rebalancing and can be volatile, necessitating a clear understanding and strategy for their use. Next Steps for Users Binance advises users holding any of the mentioned leveraged tokens to either trade them for other tokens prior to the cessation of trading services or redeem them through the wallet function or Leveraged Tokens page before their respective delisting times. The automatic removal of trade orders for these tokens will occur at the cessation time, emphasizing the need for timely action from the users' side. Binance\u2019s Commitment to Adaptation and User Support This announcement reflects Binance's commitment to adapting its service offerings to focus on products that align with user interests and market trends. It also highlights the importance of regular product evaluations to ensure compliance and competitive edge in the fast-paced cryptocurrency market. Binance assures continued support for its users throughout this transition, providing detailed guidance on how to manage their leveraged token holdings effectively. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, exchanges like Binance play a pivotal role in shaping market practices and offerings. The cessation of support for leveraged tokens by Binance marks a significant shift in its product strategy, driven by a focus on user value and service competitiveness. Users affected by this change are encouraged to take prompt action to adjust their trading strategies and holdings accordingly. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The announcement that a cabinet decision has been made to alter the law that governs Limited Partnership Funds (LPS) was made by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on February 16, 2024. This is an important step that will help to support the development of Web3 enterprises in Japan, according to Coinpost. Because of this modification, LPS will be allowed to take possession of cryptocurrency and keep them as assets. It is anticipated that the modification would reduce the obstacles that Japanese venture capital (VC) firms face when attempting to participate in projects that solely issue cryptocurrencies. This will make it simpler for Web3 enterprises in Japan to get financing. There is a general consensus among those working in the industry that this new development is positive. A typical structure for venture capital investments in Japan is known as a restricted Partnership Fund (LPF). This structure is intended to invest in startups that are not listed on any stock exchanges, and the liability of the partners is restricted to the amount of cash that they have contributed. As of right now, the rules that are in place only allow LPS to transfer stocks and other comparable instruments to its investors; cryptocurrencies are not included in this category. Web3 enterprises, who are not permitted to issue conventional shares, have fewer funding choices available to them as a result of this limitation. The statement has been especially well received by pioneers in the Web3 field, such as Hiro Kunimitsu, CEO of Thirdverse, who brought attention to the difficulties that Web3 initiatives had when attempting to obtain domestic venture capital financing under the existing regulatory framework. With a positive attitude, he stated his hope that the newly enacted law will encourage the establishment of Web3 companies in Japan. It is anticipated that this legislation reform would not only be beneficial to LPS by increasing the prospects for investment, but it will also be in line with Japan's larger aim to embrace Web3 technology and enterprises. The measure, which is part of efforts to boost Japan's industrial competitiveness and foster the establishment of new businesses, will be presented to the 213th regular session of the National Diet, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, which has indicated that it would be filed.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-16",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, French Hill, Elizabeth Warren, cryptocurrency regulation, blockchain technology, bitcoin miners, validators, and anti-money laundering are all terms that you should be familiar with. The goal of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, which is being led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Roger Marshall, is to fix gaps that might potentially enable criminals to launder money via the use of cryptocurrencies. Critics, on the other hand, claim that the proposed law might amount to an excessive amount of authority since it would treat software developers and transaction validators as if they were financial institutions. This could possibly stifle innovation and the usage of cryptocurrencies. There are fears that such restrictions would not be able to effectively prohibit terrorist groups from utilizing digital assets for the purpose of illegal fundraising, and these issues are brought up by critics, like Representative French Hill. On Capitol Hill, this piece of legislation has ignited a heated discussion, with proponents advocating for tougher monitoring to stop money laundering operations related with crypto assets. They also emphasize the need for updated regulations to address this contemporary problem. Opponents, on the other hand, are concerned that the widespread implementation of these rules might effectively outlaw cryptocurrency by placing unachievable criteria on individuals within the blockchain ecosystem, such as miners and validators. The existence of these issues highlights the persistent contradiction that exists between the necessity for regulatory frameworks that safeguard against financial crimes and the need to support technical innovation and financial privacy within the fast growing realm of digital assets. This discussion is a subset of a wider discussion that is taking on regarding the function of digital assets within the framework of the global financial system and the equilibrium that exists between innovation and regulation. The consequences of such legislative measures will have a substantial influence on the future of cryptocurrency operations and their incorporation into mainstream finance. This is because digital currencies are continuing to acquire importance. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The recent developments in the legal proceedings against Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, a towering figure in the cryptocurrency world, have sent ripples across the financial and legal sectors. Zhao, known for his pivotal role in establishing Binance as a behemoth in the cryptocurrency exchange market, now faces a daunting legal challenge. His sentencing for money laundering, initially set and anticipated to conclude with an 18-month incarceration, has been postponed. This decision comes in the wake of a filing by the prosecution, which has put forward a case for a significantly harsher punishment than previously expected. At the heart of this legal battle are allegations of money laundering, a serious and complex charge that implicates not just Zhao but the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Money laundering, the process of making large amounts of money generated by a criminal activity appear to be legally obtained, poses a significant threat to the financial system's integrity. The charges against Zhao underscore the ongoing concerns regulators have regarding the potential use of cryptocurrency platforms for illicit activities due to their perceived anonymity and lack of regulatory oversight. The prosecution's recent motion to seek a harsher sentence for Zhao than the originally agreed-upon 18 months highlights the gravity with which the authorities view his alleged offenses. This move signals a tougher stance on financial crimes, especially those involving emerging technologies like cryptocurrencies, which have long been criticized for their potential to circumvent traditional financial regulations and controls. The rescheduling of Zhao's sentencing to April 30 offers a moment for reflection on the broader implications of this case. For one, it raises critical questions about the regulatory compliance of cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance, under Zhao's leadership, has been at the forefront of the crypto revolution, facilitating billions of dollars in transactions. However, this case brings to light the regulatory challenges and obligations that come with such a dominant position in the market. It underscores the necessity for cryptocurrency platforms to implement robust measures to prevent financial crimes, ensuring they do not become conduits for money laundering or other illicit activities. Moreover, this case serves as a stark reminder of the personal accountability of executives in the cryptocurrency industry. As regulators worldwide tighten their grip on digital assets, the actions of individuals like Zhao come under increased scrutiny. The potential for a harsher sentence emphasizes the importance of adherence to legal and regulatory standards, not just for the survival and legitimacy of individual platforms like Binance but for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. The impact of Zhao's legal proceedings extends beyond the courtroom, touching on the future of cryptocurrency regulation, the balance between innovation and compliance, and the role of leadership in navigating the complex legal landscape. As the crypto community watches closely, the outcome of this case could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future, influencing regulatory approaches and the measures crypto exchanges must take to operate within the bounds of the law. In conclusion, the rescheduling of Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao's sentencing is more than just a legal procedure; it is a critical juncture in the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency regulation. It highlights the ongoing tension between innovation and regulatory compliance, the responsibilities of industry leaders, and the imperative for robust measures against financial crimes. As the April 30 sentencing date approaches, the crypto industry and regulatory bodies alike await with bated breath, recognizing that the ramifications of this case will likely reverberate for years to come, shaping the future of digital assets and their place within the global financial ecosystem.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The call for cryptocurrency regulation in Nigeria has intensified, highlighting the urgent need to address financial crimes, particularly money laundering, within the burgeoning digital currency space. Adedeji Owonibi, the co-founder of A&D Forensics, has been at the forefront of this advocacy, emphasizing the role of regulation in curbing these illicit activities. His insights shed light on the complexities and challenges of cryptocurrency transactions, underscoring the imperative for government intervention through regulation. Owonibi's stance on the matter is clear; without stringent regulation, the cryptocurrency sector in Nigeria remains a fertile ground for financial malfeasance. He argues that the Nigerian government needs to establish comprehensive laws governing cryptocurrency activities to deter and mitigate the risk of money laundering and other financial crimes. This perspective is particularly relevant in the wake of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) lifting its ban on crypto transactions, allowing banks to operate accounts for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). The importance of such regulation cannot be overstated, especially considering Nigeria's position as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market. Despite previous regulatory challenges, including a ban by the CBN, cryptocurrency usage in Nigeria has seen a remarkable surge. The country ranks prominently in global crypto adoption indexes, driven by factors such as limited access to traditional banking services, currency depreciation, and inflation. This uptick in crypto activity, however, also raises the specter of increased financial crimes, making the call for regulation all the more critical. Owonibi's insights also highlight the potential for regulatory frameworks to enhance the security and scalability of the crypto industry. He points out the developmental regulation crafted by The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) as a significant step toward creating a favorable environment for blockchain and crypto industry growth. This move, according to Owonibi, is what the CBN should have considered back in 2021 instead of severing ties between cryptocurrency exchange firms and local banks. Furthermore, Owonibi delves into the intricacies of tracking and investigating cryptocurrency fraud, revealing that while Over-The-Counter (OTC) transactions and crypto mixers pose challenges to law enforcement, advancements in regulatory technology and international cooperation are improving the ability to trace illicit activities. He emphasizes the evolving landscape of blockchain anonymity and the global efforts to establish standards for transaction traceability, underscoring the significance of regulatory measures in combating cryptocurrency scams.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "For Super Bowl LVIII, the crypto community's rumors about the absence of cryptocurrency advertisements have been confirmed. Unlike the previous years, particularly Super Bowl LVI in 2022, when crypto ads were prominently featured with companies like FTX leading the charge with high-profile commercials featuring celebrities like Larry David, this year marks a significant shift. The focus has decidedly moved away from financial technology themes towards \"fun, humor, and entertainment,\" with no cryptocurrency exchange ads expected to be part of the lineup. This transition reflects a broader trend in the advertising strategy for the event, with high-profile brands such as BMW, Budweiser, State Farm, Oreo, DoorDash, and Hellman\u2019s Mayonnaise taking center stage. The change comes after the noticeable absence of digital asset ads in Super Bowl LVII in 2023, following a tumultuous period for the crypto market marked by several bankruptcy filings from major crypto firms and a significant market downturn. The decision to exclude crypto ads from Super Bowl LVIII underscores a strategic pivot to entertainment-focused content, possibly aiming to appeal to a broader audience beyond the financial technology enthusiasts. This move also might reflect a cautious approach from advertisers and the event organizers, considering the legal and financial controversies that followed the collapse of major players like FTX, which faced numerous lawsuits from investors. In summary, Super Bowl LVIII presents a notable departure from recent trends of featuring cryptocurrency advertisements, opting instead for a lineup that emphasizes entertainment and mainstream appeal. This shift highlights the evolving nature of advertising strategies in high-profile events and the changing landscape of the cryptocurrency industry's public relations efforts.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a significant move to safeguard investors, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), together with the local police force, has raised an alarm over a fraudulent scheme involving an entity impersonating the well-known cryptocurrency exchange MEXC. This alert comes as part of their intensified efforts to clamp down on illegal activities within the virtual asset trading sector, demonstrating the authorities' commitment to monitoring and investigating potential frauds that jeopardize investor interests. The fraudulent entity, posing as MEXC, has been actively deceiving investors by directing them to a series of counterfeit websites, all bearing the MEXC name within their domain names, such as \u201Cmexczx.icu\u201D and \u201Cmexczx.co.\u201D Victims were lured into depositing funds into specific bank accounts under the guise of investing in cryptocurrencies, only to face challenges when attempting to withdraw their funds later. This scheme not only highlights the sophisticated tactics employed by fraudsters to exploit the burgeoning interest in cryptocurrency investments but also underscores the critical need for investors to remain vigilant and conduct thorough due diligence before engaging with any investment platforms. The SFC has identified and listed eight such suspicious websites and has warned the public to be wary of similar sites that may emerge, signifying a proactive approach to prevent further victimization. Additionally, the regulatory body has been transparent in its efforts to educate the public about the risks associated with unregulated virtual asset trading platforms, further evidenced by their recent initiative to publish a list of licensed, deemed licensed, and application-pending virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) to aid investors in distinguishing between regulated and potentially unregulated entities. This incident also casts a spotlight on the broader implications for the crypto exchange industry, with MEXC itself taking steps to clear its name and denounce the imposters, emphasizing its commitment to maintaining a secure and trustworthy trading environment for its users. MEXC has advised its community to only trust its official website, mexc.com, and stay alert to the dangers of interacting with fraudulent platforms. The collaborative efforts between the Hong Kong SFC and police in tackling such fraudulent activities signal a robust regulatory stance against crypto fraud, reflecting a growing trend of regulatory bodies worldwide stepping up to ensure the integrity of the virtual asset market and protect investors from potential scams. In summary, this episode serves as a critical reminder of the ever-present risks in the digital asset space and the importance of regulatory and law enforcement agencies in safeguarding the financial ecosystem. Investors are urged to exercise caution and prioritize security when navigating the complex landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "California's burgeoning cryptocurrency community is poised to play a decisive role in the 2024 elections. According to data from Coinbase, revealed through a collaboration with Morning Consult, an impressive 27% of Californians, translating to approximately 8.2 million people, are cryptocurrency owners. This significant demographic, known for their preference for innovation and disruptive technologies, could sway election outcomes, particularly favoring candidates with pro-crypto stances. The Pro-Crypto Sentiment and Its Implications A notable 78% of California's crypto holders are inclined towards policies that foster innovation, with a similar percentage ready to support candidates who align with their pro-crypto and blockchain visions. This sentiment extends beyond state lines, mirroring a national trend, especially among younger voters. Approximately 51% of Gen Z and millennials across the United States express a likelihood to vote for candidates who are favorable towards cryptocurrencies in the upcoming elections. Political Engagement and Regulatory Desires The crypto community's political engagement is not just about backing pro-crypto candidates; it also encompasses a call for clear and stable crypto regulations. This desire stems from the community's frustration with the current \"regulation-by-enforcement\" approach, which they find unpredictable and stifling for the industry's growth. The push for definitive regulations reflects a broader consensus among digital asset holders and advocates, emphasizing the need for a legal framework that nurtures innovation while ensuring investor protection. The Election and Beyond: A Focus on Crypto-Friendly Policies As the 2024 elections approach, the focus on digital assets and crypto-friendly policies is intensifying. Political figures and potential candidates are increasingly acknowledging the importance of crypto policies in their campaigns. The conversation around cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and their regulation is expected to play a significant role in shaping the political landscape and policy decisions in the U.S., indicating the growing influence of digital asset owners in American politics. Summary The intersection of cryptocurrency ownership and political engagement is set to have a profound impact on the 2024 elections in California and potentially across the U.S. As candidates and policymakers vie for the support of this influential voter bloc, the crypto community's preferences for innovation, technological advancement, and clear regulations are likely to shape future electoral outcomes and regulatory landscapes.

        "articleSummary": "The United Nations is probing DPRK-linked hacking groups for orchestrating cyberattacks on cryptocurrency firms, amassing $3 billion over six years to fund WMD development. These cybercrimes, targeting 58 companies, underscore a sophisticated operation defying international sanctions.",
        "creationDate": "2024-02-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United Nations (UN) is currently leading an investigation into a series of cyberattacks orchestrated by groups linked to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), targeting cryptocurrency firms over a six-year span. These operations have reportedly generated approximately $3 billion in profits, which are believed to support North Korea's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) development programs. The investigation, supervised by an independent sanctions committee, has identified 58 cryptocurrency-related companies as victims between 2017 and 2023. The primary focus of these cyberattacks has been to circumvent international sanctions and bolster North Korea's WMD capabilities, including its nuclear arsenal. Despite facing stringent UN sanctions aimed at cutting off funding for its WMD programs, North Korea has managed to continue its nuclear and missile development efforts. The UN sanctions, intensified over the years since their initial imposition in 2006, have sought to curb North Korea's access to the international financial system and restrict its ability to develop and proliferate nuclear weapons. Recent analyses by blockchain intelligence firms such as Chainalysis have shed light on the scale of DPRK's cyber operations. In 2023 alone, DPRK-linked hacking groups were responsible for about $1 billion in cryptocurrency theft through 20 separate attacks, indicating a significant but slightly reduced activity level compared to the $1.7 billion stolen across 15 incidents in 2022. Despite advancements in cybersecurity measures and increased international cooperation in tracking and recovering stolen funds, experts predict that DPRK's cybercriminal activities will continue to pose a significant threat. Advanced attack methodologies are expected to be employed by these groups, challenging global efforts to combat cybercrime. The forthcoming UN report, expected to be published in the near future, aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these cyberattacks and their implications for global security and the international financial system. It will highlight the ongoing challenges posed by DPRK's sophisticated cyber operations and the need for concerted international efforts to mitigate their impact. The case of DPRK's cyberattacks on cryptocurrency firms underscores the complex interplay between cybersecurity, international finance, and global efforts to prevent the proliferation of WMDs. It reflects the growing challenge of addressing state-sponsored cyber activities that not only threaten the security of the digital economy but also have broader implications for international peace and security.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-09",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has found itself at the center of controversy following its lawsuit against Digital Licensing, operating as Debt Box. The case took an unexpected turn when the SEC admitted to not being \"accurate and candid\" in its filings with the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, Northern Division. This admission prompted a request to the court for dismissal of the case, a move that has since drawn significant criticism from five Republican senators. In a letter addressed to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Senators JD Vance, Thom Tillis, Bill Hagerty, Cynthia Lummis, and Katie Boyd Britt expressed their \"great concern\" over the SEC's handling of the case. They labeled the commission's conduct as \"unethical and unprofessional,\" spotlighting the potential implications such actions might have on the credibility of other enforcement activities undertaken by the SEC. The senators emphasized the importance of maintaining public confidence in the SEC's regulatory oversight, especially given the complex and rapidly changing nature of the crypto industry. The lawsuit against Debt Box was originally filed in July 2023, with the SEC alleging that the firm had engaged in an illegal $50 million crypto scheme. However, the subsequent acknowledgment of inaccuracies in the SEC's claims against Debt Box has raised questions about the rigor and reliability of the commission's investigative and enforcement processes. The case has highlighted the challenges regulatory bodies face in governing the crypto space, a domain that is marked by its novelty, technological complexity, and regulatory ambiguity. This incident is particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of ongoing lawsuits by the SEC against other major players in the cryptocurrency market, including Binance, Kraken, Ripple, and Coinbase. It underscores the need for transparency, accuracy, and ethical conduct in regulatory enforcement, principles that are fundamental to maintaining trust in the financial system and the rule of law. The SEC's decision to pursue mandatory staff training and personnel reshuffling in response to this incident suggests a recognition of the need for internal reforms. However, the senators' letter indicates that such measures may be insufficient to address the underlying issues, calling for a more comprehensive review of the SEC's enforcement strategies and practices. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, the SEC's approach to regulation and enforcement will undoubtedly remain under scrutiny. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of regulatory integrity and the potential consequences of procedural missteps in the high-stakes world of financial regulation.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-09",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is currently embroiled in a significant legal battle, with a class-action lawsuit filed against it over its association with the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, Voyager Digital. This lawsuit, seeking damages exceeding $4.2 billion, accuses the NBA of negligence in its promotional activities with Voyager, which also involved marketing ties with Mark Cuban, the former owner of the Dallas Mavericks. The plaintiffs argue that the NBA's endorsement effectively legitimized Voyager's unregistered securities, contributing to substantial financial losses for the exchange's users when it collapsed. Voyager Digital's bankruptcy filing in July 2022 marked a significant downturn in the crypto market, primarily due to its heavy reliance on investments with the failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. This led to the suspension of customer withdrawals, causing widespread financial distress among its investors. The lawsuit implicates not just the NBA but also extends to the role played by Mark Cuban in promoting Voyager. Cuban himself has faced legal scrutiny in a separate lawsuit, which alleges that he misrepresented the safety of investments in Voyager, although he has denied these claims. The litigation against the NBA and other associated entities, such as Voyager's law firm McCarter & English, reflects the broader concerns regarding celebrity endorsements and the partnerships between crypto companies and mainstream organizations. This legal challenge may very well set a precedent for the responsibilities and liabilities of brands and public figures who endorse cryptocurrency platforms and products, highlighting the need for due diligence and transparency in such endorsements. The unfolding of this lawsuit is closely watched by stakeholders in both the sports and cryptocurrency industries, as it underscores the risks and complexities at the intersection of digital finance and mainstream endorsement. The legal outcomes could influence future marketing strategies, celebrity endorsements, and the regulatory landscape surrounding digital currencies and their promotion. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the potential repercussions for entities that venture into it without fully grasitating the associated risks and regulatory requirements. This case not only raises questions about the legal responsibilities of promoting cryptocurrency investments but also emphasizes the importance of investor protection in the rapidly evolving digital finance sector. As the lawsuit progresses, it will undoubtedly shed light on the intricate dynamics between sports, entertainment, digital currencies, and the law, potentially reshaping the approach to marketing and endorsements in these interconnected domains.

        "detailedArticleContent": "UBS AG's recent announcement heralds the launch of Hong Kong's first-ever investment-grade tokenized warrant, leveraging the Ethereum public blockchain network. This pioneering product, a call warrant with Xiaomi Corporation as the underlying asset, signifies the fusion of conventional financial mechanisms with the avant-garde blockchain technology, potentially reshaping the landscape of digital finance. This innovative tokenized warrant, sold to OSL Digital Securities Limited, represents the first of its kind to be natively issued on a public blockchain, underscoring a significant evolution in the realm of financial derivatives. The collaboration between UBS and OSL, a subsidiary of OSL Group, emphasizes the growing synergy between traditional banking institutions and the burgeoning field of digital assets. Winni Cheuk, Head of Sales at UBS Global Markets, APAC Public Distribution, and Patrick Pan, CEO of OSL Group, both highlighted the myriad benefits introduced by this novel product.

The tokenized warrant utilizes smart contracts to automate and optimize trading and administrative tasks, thereby increasing efficiency and lowering operational costs. The tokenization of financial products by UBS is not a new venture; the bank has been actively exploring and implementing blockchain solutions since 2015. In 2022, UBS issued a $50 million tokenized fixed rate note to its Asia Pacific clients through its UBS Tokenize platform, further demonstrating its commitment to digital asset innovation. The issuance of the tokenized warrant in collaboration with OSL Digital Securities marks a continuation of UBS's endeavors to expand its digital asset capabilities and explore new avenues for financial products in the blockchain domain.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has launched an investigation into OKX, the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange globally by trading volume, for allegedly conducting unregistered operations within the country. This investigation forms part of South Korea's rigorous efforts to oversee and regulate the burgeoning digital asset industry, ensuring that all operating exchanges comply with local regulations. The inquiry into OKX's activities was prompted by a report from the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA), a consortium of leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. DAXA raised concerns about OKX's promotional activities targeting South Korean users, particularly through the use of influencers on the messaging platform Telegram, despite the exchange's lack of proper registration and a Korean-language website. This approach has led to speculation about the exchange's compliance with South Korean laws that mandate registration for cryptocurrency service providers. South Korea has established stringent regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges, requiring them to register with authorities before offering services to local investors. This regulatory framework aims to protect investors from fraud and other illegal activities associated with unregistered and non-compliant operations. The investigation into OKX by the FIU, under the guidance of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), signifies a crucial step in enforcing these regulations and maintaining market integrity. The outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for OKX and the broader cryptocurrency market in South Korea. If found guilty of operating without registration, OKX could face severe penalties, underscoring the South Korean government's resolve to combat illegal financial activities and ensure a safe investment environment for its citizens. This probe also highlights the collaborative effort among South Korea's top cryptocurrency exchanges to uphold regulatory compliance, setting a precedent for the importance of legal adherence in the dynamic and evolving digital asset landscape. This ongoing investigation is a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency sector in South Korea, reflecting the country's dedication to a secure, regulated environment for the growing industry. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies globally, the actions taken by South Korean authorities may serve as a model for other nations grappling with similar regulatory challenges in the cryptocurrency domain.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The CEO of Bitsonic, a cryptocurrency exchange, has been sentenced to seven years in prison. The Seoul Eastern District Court found the executive guilty of inflating the market value and trading volume of a coin issued by the exchange and embezzling approximately 10 billion won (about $8.4 million USD) in customer deposits. This case marks a significant moment in the ongoing effort to regulate the cryptocurrency market, which has been fraught with volatility and accusations of lack of transparency. The court's decision sends a strong message to other cryptocurrency exchanges and their operators about the severe consequences of engaging in fraudulent activities. The charges against the Bitsonic CEO included fraud under the Specific Economic Crimes Act, fabrication and use of electronic records, and obstruction of business by damaging computer systems. Alongside the CEO, Bitsonic's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) was also convicted, receiving a one-year prison sentence for his role in creating and exploiting computer system failures to facilitate the fraud. The court highlighted the misuse of the positions held by the CEO and CTO to disable the essential information processing functions of the cryptocurrency exchange. They created an illusion of legitimate trading activity, which significantly inflated the trading volumes. This deceitful practice led to the embezzlement of vast sums from numerous victims over an extended period. The Bitsonic case is part of a broader context of regulatory and legal challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry globally. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are grappling with how to oversee a market that prides itself on decentralization and operates beyond the bounds of traditional financial systems. Incidents like these underline the urgent need for clearer regulations and more robust oversight to protect investors and maintain market integrity. The repercussions of this case extend beyond the immediate legal consequences for the individuals involved. They highlight the vulnerabilities within the cryptocurrency market and the potential for abuse. As the industry continues to evolve, it will likely face increased scrutiny and demands for transparency and accountability. This ruling also emphasizes the importance of due diligence by investors in the digital asset space. The allure of high returns often comes with high risks, especially in markets susceptible to manipulation and fraud. Investors are urged to research thoroughly and approach cryptocurrency investments with caution. As the cryptocurrency market matures, the Bitsonic case may serve as a cautionary tale that steers the industry toward more ethical practices and contributes to the development of a safer, more transparent market for all participants.

The details remain sealed to protect sensitive information amidst BlockFi's bankruptcy proceedings and its implications on the broader crypto market.",
        "creationDate": "2024-02-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A US judge has recently approved a settlement between the cryptocurrency lending platform BlockFi and the bankrupt hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), aiming to resolve their disputes without further legal confrontations. The agreement, sanctioned during a hearing on February 6th by Judge Michael Kaplan at the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, remains under wraps as the details of the settlement have been ordered to stay sealed. This decision was made despite BlockFi's motion to seal certain information, arguing that the disclosure could potentially affect ongoing litigation with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The sealed nature of the settlement is intended to protect commercially sensitive information and to honor the foreign bankruptcy proceedings involving 3AC. The core of the dispute lay in the financial claims each company made against the other; BlockFi alleged that 3AC owed it $129 million, while 3AC countered with a claim that BlockFi owed it $280 million. Judge Kaplan's decision to keep the settlement details confidential was defended as being in the best interest of all parties involved, including the creditors of BlockFi. By sealing the settlement, the court aims to shield the strategic considerations of the settlement and maintain the integrity of 3AC's foreign bankruptcy proceedings. The approval of this settlement is a significant step for BlockFi as it allows the company to proceed with the distribution of assets from its lending estate to its creditors. This is a crucial phase in BlockFi's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, which saw the company file for bankruptcy in late November 2022 following the downfall of FTX. BlockFi's financial obligations at the time of its bankruptcy filing were substantial, with estimates suggesting the company owed up to $10 billion to over 100,000 creditors, including significant amounts to its three largest creditors and to 3AC. The collapse of Three Arrows Capital in June 2022 and subsequent legal and financial repercussions highlight the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and the complex web of interdependencies among its players. This settlement, although sealed, marks a pivotal resolution in one of the many legal battles stemming from the cascading failures of prominent entities within the cryptocurrency space. This situation underscores the broader challenges and risks facing the cryptocurrency industry, including regulatory scrutiny, market volatility, and the intricate legal battles that can arise from financial disputes. As the industry continues to mature, the outcomes of such legal proceedings will likely shape the regulatory and operational landscape for crypto businesses moving forward.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The US Federal Reserve announced the termination of its enforcement action against Farmington State Bank, a financial entity previously entangled with the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. This move comes after the bank effectively wound down its operations, transitioning away from its role as a banking institution and ensuring the protection of its depositors' interests. Farmington State Bank, which operated under the name Moonstone Bank before its involvement with FTX's trading arm, Alameda Research, faced scrutiny from regulatory bodies due to its sudden shift in business strategy without proper notification to its supervisors. This led to the Federal Reserve's enforcement action in July 2023, aimed at overseeing a structured wind-down process for the bank, safeguarding depositor assets in the process. The termination of this enforcement action by the Federal Reserve not only marks the end of Farmington's banking operations but also closes a chapter on the regulatory challenges faced by financial institutions linked with cryptocurrency firms. The case had attracted attention from lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith, who had raised concerns about the potential integration of crypto entities into the traditional banking system and the implications for financial stability. The Federal Reserve's decision also accompanied the conclusion of two other enforcement actions against BNP Paribas in Paris, France, underscoring a broader regulatory effort to maintain oversight over financial institutions' activities, especially those intersecting with the dynamic and often volatile cryptocurrency market. This development sheds light on the growing challenges and regulatory considerations for banks involved with cryptocurrencies, highlighting the need for clear communication with regulatory bodies and adherence to established financial practices. It also reflects the ongoing dialogue between the financial sector and regulators regarding the safe and responsible integration of crypto assets into mainstream banking operations. As the financial landscape continues to evolve with the integration of digital assets, the termination of the enforcement action against Farmington State Bank serves as a reminder of the regulatory vigilance required to protect depositors and maintain financial stability in an increasingly complex and interconnected market.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States has recently decided to delay its judgment about the exchange-traded fund (ETF) that Invesco and Galaxy Digital have proposed to be a spot Ether (ETH) currency. During this delay, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the possibility of listing and trading such an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the timeframe for its final decision by an additional 35 days, making it possible for the public to provide feedback on the plan. The proposal was published in the Federal Register. Because of this step, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will have up to 240 days in total to reach a final judgment about the exchange-traded fund (ETF). The first file will be submitted by the asset management in October 2023, and it will be published in November. This brings the deadline for the SEC's decision to July 2024. Prior to granting approval for the public trading of Ether-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically taken a cautious stance toward financial products connected to cryptocurrencies. This deferral reflects the SEC's goal to guarantee full market assessment and investor protection. In its request for public comments on this proposal, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) highlights its effort to gather insights on various aspects, such as the ETF's compliance with the Exchange's rules for commodity-based trust shares and considerations about the distinctive characteristics of Ether and its ecosystem, such as its proof of stake consensus mechanism and the concentration of control or influence. In order to provide investors with a well-regulated and publicly traded vehicle through which they may obtain exposure to Ether, the proposed Invesco Galaxy Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) intends to monitor the spot price of Ether. This project is a part of a larger trend of investment businesses that are looking to incorporate bitcoin assets into conventional financial markets. The goal of this movement is to provide a bridge between digital currencies and fiat currencies within the context of regulated frameworks. As part of a larger narrative in which regulatory bodies are weighing the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial products, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently deliberating over the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The outcome of this discussion has the potential to establish precedents for future cryptocurrency ETFs and other financial instruments that are based on digital assets. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Digital Currency Group (DCG) has expressed strong opposition to the bankruptcy plan proposed by its subsidiary, Genesis Global Capital, arguing that the plan contravenes the Bankruptcy Code by intending to overcompensate customers. DCG's main contention is that Genesis' plan proposes to pay its customers and unsecured creditors significantly more than what they are legally entitled to, specifically criticizing the plan for offering \"additional payouts\" based on the current value of digital assets like bitcoin and ethereum, which have appreciated in value since Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January 2023. DCG has made it clear that it supports fully repaying creditors but insists that any repayment should not exceed the value of the crypto assets at the time of the bankruptcy filing. The company emphasizes that the proposed plan unfairly benefits a select group of creditors at the expense of others, including DCG, by offering them additional payouts that reflect the current, higher value of the digital assets rather than their value at the time of filing. This approach, according to DCG, not only violates U.S. bankruptcy laws but also deprives DCG of essential economic and corporate governance rights. Furthermore, DCG's opposition is rooted in a broader concern over the fair treatment of all creditors and adherence to legal standards within bankruptcy proceedings. The company has filed a motion urging the court not to approve Genesis' plan, arguing that it is unlawful and demonstrates a lack of good faith in the restructuring process. Genesis has been attempting to navigate its financial difficulties following the crypto market downturn in 2022, which led to its bankruptcy filing in early 2023 with over $3.5 billion owed to its top creditors. The bankruptcy saga has been complicated by legal challenges, including a significant settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and ongoing disputes with DCG and Gemini, its former business partner. This dispute highlights the complex dynamics between parent companies and their subsidiaries in the cryptocurrency sector, especially in the context of bankruptcy and asset valuation. The outcome of this disagreement could set a precedent for how crypto assets are valued and creditors are compensated in bankruptcy cases moving forward. Image source: Shutterstock"

The move underscores a strategic pivot towards digital assets amid fluctuating tech and financial landscapes.",
        "creationDate": "2024-02-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "MicroStrategy Incorporated, a titan in the realm of business intelligence and the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, revealed its financial outcomes for Q4 2023, a period marked by ambitious digital asset acquisitions and a nuanced shift in its revenue structure. Despite a year-over-year revenue decrease, the company's strategic maneuvers in the cryptocurrency domain underscore a broader industry trend towards digital asset adoption and innovation in financial strategies. During the final quarter of 2023, MicroStrategy acquired an additional 31,755 bitcoins for $1.25 billion, averaging $39,411 per bitcoin. This aggressive accumulation strategy has expanded its bitcoin holdings to 190,000 BTC, valued at $5.93 billion, or $31,224 per bitcoin as of February 5, 2024. This development not only reaffirms MicroStrategy's commitment to bitcoin as a core asset but also highlights its confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The company's Q4 revenue stood at $124.5 million, marking a 6% decline from the previous year. Despite the downturn in total revenues, subscription services experienced a 23% uptick, indicating a strategic pivot towards cloud-based offerings and a reinforcement of MicroStrategy's software and service capabilities. This shift aligns with the broader industry trend of moving towards subscription models and cloud solutions, suggesting a resilient adaptation to changing market demands. MicroStrategy's operational narrative in 2023 was significantly influenced by its bitcoin strategy. The company's CFO, Andrew Kang, highlighted the quarter as the largest bitcoin holding increase in three years and a testament to the company's strategic financial maneuvers. This approach has not only provided a hedge against traditional financial volatility but also positioned MicroStrategy as a pioneer in corporate digital asset investment. The financial results also detailed operational efficiencies and adjustments in response to the evolving market landscape. Operating expenses saw a significant reduction, contributing to a net income of $89.1 million for the quarter, a stark contrast to the net loss in the same period the previous year. This turnaround can be attributed to a strategic alignment of its investment and operational strategies, emphasizing the potential of digital assets to bolster financial resilience. However, the journey was not without its challenges. The reported decrease in revenue highlights the competitive and unpredictable nature of both the technology and cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, the digital asset segment remains susceptible to market volatilities, as evidenced by the cumulative impairment losses on bitcoin holdings. Yet, MicroStrategy's continued investment in bitcoin, alongside its foray into AI with the launch of MicroStrategy AI, signifies a forward-looking approach to navigating these uncertainties. MicroStrategy's bold moves in 2023, especially its substantial bitcoin acquisitions, reflect a broader trend of companies integrating digital assets into their treasury strategies. This approach not only diversifies their asset base but also aligns with a growing recognition of cryptocurrency's potential as both a hedge against inflation and a speculative investment opportunity. Moreover, the company's pivot towards subscription-based services and cloud solutions underscores a strategic adaptation to the evolving demands of the digital economy. In conclusion, MicroStrategy's Q4 2023 financial results encapsulate a period of strategic recalibration and investment in digital assets. Despite the challenges posed by a fluctuating market, the company's focus on bitcoin and technological innovation presents a case study in corporate resilience and adaptability. As MicroStrategy continues to navigate the intersections of technology, finance, and digital assets, its strategies offer insights into the evolving dynamics of corporate asset management and technological advancement.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, recently addressed concerns regarding phishing scams on social media, particularly in response to an incident involving Cory Doctorow, who lost over $8000 due to a scammer impersonating his bank. Schwartz, known for his strong stance on cybersecurity, confidently stated on Twitter that he is \"too smart to fall for this kind of thing,\" highlighting that while scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated and common, he believes his awareness and intelligence protect him from falling victim. This statement came after Doctorow shared his experience of being deceived by a phone phisher who managed to extract his credit card information, leading to significant financial loss. Ripple has been proactive in educating its users about the dangers of cryptocurrency scams, providing tips on how to identify, avoid, and report such scams. The company emphasizes the importance of vigilance on social media, where misinformation can spread rapidly. With the rise of imposter scams costing consumers billions, Ripple's guidance includes being wary of too-good-to-be-true offers, the sophistication of impersonation tactics using legitimate company imagery, and the emergence of deepfake technology that makes scams even more convincing. They also recommend verifying giveaway ads through official company channels and exercising caution with financial information. Ripple encourages reporting suspicious behavior to help combat the spread of these fraudulent activities. Moreover, in a broader conversation about Ripple's role in the cryptocurrency space, Schwartz discusses the impact of the SEC lawsuit on Ripple's operations, particularly regarding the delisting of XRP from exchanges, which posed challenges to Ripple's strategy of leveraging XRP for cross-border payments. Despite these hurdles, Schwartz highlights RippleNet's continued growth in markets outside the U.S., such as the Asia Pacific and the Middle East. He also delves into Ripple's technological advancements, like the 'Hooks' feature for adding smart contract-like functionality to the XRP Ledger, and addresses the company's approach to dealing with the enthusiastic yet sometimes problematic XRP fan base. These insights from Schwartz and Ripple's efforts underscore the company's commitment to security, innovation, and community engagement amid the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A U.S. district judge has recently made a significant ruling in the ongoing legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple, ordering Ripple to disclose more detailed financial information and data on its institutional sales of XRP. This decision is seen as a victory for the SEC, which has been in a lawsuit with Ripple for over three years. The lawsuit centers around allegations that Ripple engaged in unregistered sales of its XRP token, a claim Ripple has contested. The court's order specifically requires Ripple to provide financial statements for the years 2022 and 2023, along with contracts governing institutional sales of XRP that occurred after the SEC filed its complaint against Ripple. This information is deemed crucial for determining the appropriate penalties in the case, as the court looks to establish whether Ripple's institutional sales of XRP were in violation of securities law. The ruling follows a previous decision by Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District Court of New York, which found that while XRP sales to institutional investors constituted unlawful securities sales, sales to retail investors did not fall under this categorization. Ripple had argued that the company\u2019s financial health was irrelevant to the lawsuit, a position the court ultimately rejected. The court agreed with the SEC that the information on post-complaint institutional sales of XRP is relevant to deciding on possible legal remedies, which may include injunctions and civil penalties. This development is part of a broader SEC enforcement campaign against major U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges and highlights ongoing regulatory challenges faced by the crypto industry. The trial between Ripple and the SEC is set to commence in April 2024, marking a critical juncture in a case that has drawn significant attention from the cryptocurrency community and regulators alike. Ripple\u2019s legal team has criticized the SEC's approach towards the crypto industry, framing it as excessively aggressive. The outcome of this case could have wide-reaching implications for the regulation of digital assets in the United States. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On February 2, 2024, the British Columbia Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, upholding an Order in Council (OIC) that temporarily suspended BC Hydro's obligation to supply electricity to new cryptocurrency mining operations for 18 months. The ruling, delivered by Justice Tammen, dismissed the petition by Conifex Timber Inc., a forestry company aiming to diversify into high-performance computing data centers primarily for cryptocurrency mining. Background of the Case The controversy began with the OIC issued on December 21, 2022, directing the British Columbia Utilities Commission (BCUC) to relieve BC Hydro from supplying service to new cryptocurrency mining projects, affecting two of Conifex's data centre projects. The government's directive was rooted in concerns over the massive electricity demand from cryptocurrency mining operations and its potential impact on the province's energy resources and climate goals. Key Findings of the Court The court found that the OIC was a reasonable exercise of the Lieutenant Governor in Council's authority under the Utilities Commission Act (UCA). It determined that the directive did not constitute undue discrimination against cryptocurrency miners, as it was justified on a cost-of-service basis due to the unique and substantial electricity consumption characteristics of cryptocurrency mining operations. Justice Tammen also addressed the procedural fairness argument, highlighting that the OIC's purpose was to temporarily pause the electricity supply to large cryptocurrency projects to allow for consultation and policy development concerning the industry's energy consumption. Implications of the Decision This decision has significant implications for the cryptocurrency mining industry in British Columbia, signaling the government's authority to regulate utility services based on broader policy considerations, including environmental sustainability and energy conservation. It also underscores the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency mining sector, which is known for its intensive energy use, in regions prioritizing clean energy transitions and climate change initiatives. The ruling may prompt other jurisdictions to consider similar measures to manage the energy demands of high-consumption industries like cryptocurrency mining, especially in areas where energy resources are strained or where there's a strong commitment to environmental goals. Future Considerations The court's decision highlights the need for industries, particularly those with significant energy demands, to align their operations with regional energy policies and environmental objectives. It also emphasizes the importance of government and regulatory bodies in balancing industrial demands with sustainability goals and the public interest. As the conversation around cryptocurrency mining and energy consumption evolves, stakeholders across the spectrum \u2014 from industry participants to policymakers \u2014 will need to navigate the complex interplay between innovation, economic development, and environmental stewardship.

        "detailedArticleContent": "South Korea prosecutors have detained three executives from the cryptocurrency yield platform Haru Invest, including its two co-CEOs, on serious charges of embezzlement. They are accused of misappropriating approximately 1.1 trillion Korean won (around $826 million) from about 16,000 users. This case has raised global concerns regarding the stability and transparency of the cryptocurrency sector, especially around crypto lending practices. Investigations have revealed that Haru Invest advertised its deposits as being managed through \"risk-free distributed investment techniques,\" despite allegedly investing most of its client deposits through a single individual. This malpractice led to the abrupt suspension of withdrawals in June 2023, exposing the vulnerabilities and risks associated with the crypto lending industry. The firm had offered up to 12% yield for its Earn Plus product users, a claim that has now come under scrutiny. The arrests follow a broader regulatory crackdown aimed at safeguarding consumers and ensuring the stability of the cryptocurrency sector. This incident underscores the need for more stringent oversight and transparent operations within the crypto lending space to protect investors from fraudulent activities. The case also reflects on the potential risks and challenges that investors face in the rapidly evolving digital asset market, highlighting the importance of due diligence and the role of regulatory bodies in preventing such malpractices. The aftermath of the arrests and the ongoing investigations into Haru Invest and related entities, such as Delio, illustrate the interconnected risks within the crypto industry, particularly around the management and security of client deposits. The case against Haru Invest not only spotlights the significant impact of fraudulent activities on investors but also serves as a cautionary tale for the crypto industry at large, emphasizing the critical need for enhanced regulatory frameworks and operational transparency to foster a safe and stable cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (RFB) has recently identified 25,126 individuals who own bitcoins but have not declared these assets on their tax returns, revealing a significant issue of non-compliance within the realm of cryptocurrency taxation. Leveraging advanced data processing techniques, artificial intelligence, and complex network analysis, the RFB has enhanced its monitoring capabilities to track crypto transactions and the locations of individuals trading cryptocurrencies. This move is part of broader efforts to integrate modern technologies into tax regulation and enforcement, showcasing the increasing sophistication of tax authorities in dealing with the complexities of the digital economy. The discovery of these unreported assets, totaling around R$1.06 billion, underscores the challenges tax authorities face in ensuring compliance in an area known for its opacity and fluidity. Cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, offer a level of anonymity and mobility that traditional financial systems cannot match, making it difficult for regulatory bodies to track and tax these assets effectively. However, the RFB's use of cutting-edge technology represents a significant step forward in closing this gap. Moreover, the RFB announced changes to the tax declaration process for 2024, including an extension of the income tax exemption bracket and specific guidelines for cryptocurrency investors, reflecting the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets. These developments are part of a broader trend of regulatory bodies worldwide attempting to adapt to the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and the unique challenges they present to traditional financial and tax systems. The obligation to declare cryptocurrency assets applies to both individuals and legal entities, with the RFB requiring detailed records of all transactions, including dates, values, and parties involved. This requirement aims to ensure transparency and compliance, but it also places a significant burden on cryptocurrency holders to maintain accurate and comprehensive records of their transactions. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties, highlighting the importance of understanding and adhering to tax obligations in the cryptocurrency space. The case of the RFB's recent findings serves as a cautionary tale for cryptocurrency investors globally. It underscores the need for increased awareness and compliance with tax regulations, as well as the growing capabilities of tax authorities to monitor and enforce these regulations. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, both investors and regulatory bodies will need to navigate the complex interplay between innovation, privacy, and compliance to ensure a stable and transparent digital economy. This situation also highlights the importance of legal and financial advice for cryptocurrency investors. Understanding the tax implications of cryptocurrency investments and transactions is crucial for avoiding potential legal issues and ensuring compliance with tax laws. As the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies continues to develop, staying informed and proactive in tax planning will be essential for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market. In conclusion, the RFB's actions reflect a broader movement towards increased regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency market. As governments and regulatory bodies worldwide grapple with the challenges of integrating digital assets into their tax frameworks, the importance of compliance, transparency, and informed investment strategies in the cryptocurrency space has never been greater.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, has announced an update to its Futures Multi-Assets Mode that will significantly enhance the trading experience for its users. Starting from February 9, 2024, at 08:30 (UTC), all new futures accounts and sub-accounts will automatically have the Multi-Assets Mode enabled. This mode facilitates the trading of USDⓈ-M futures contracts across multiple margin assets more seamlessly, subject to applicable haircuts, thereby broadening the trading capabilities and flexibility for Binance users. The Multi-Assets Mode supports only the Cross Margin Mode and selected assets as margin. The introduction of this feature is a part of Binance's ongoing efforts to provide unparalleled trading products and services, including access to over 250+ Futures & Options contracts, a wide range of trading tools, and margin modes, accompanied by 24\/7 global expert customer support. It also comes at a time when Binance is extending its offerings, as evidenced by the recent launch of USDC-margined Dogecoin (DOGE) futures, which allows for trading the token across various margin assets under the multi-assets mode, demonstrating Binance's commitment to expanding investment options and enhancing trading experiences on its platform. Binance Futures offers a diverse range of trading products, including USDⓈ-M and COIN-M Futures, settled in stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, respectively. Regular users, who trade less than $15 million in a 30-day period or own less than 25 BNB, are subject to a maker fee of 0.02% and a taker fee of 0.05% on USDⓈ-M Futures trades, with a 10% discount available for those using BNB to pay for trades. This fee structure is designed to cater to a broad spectrum of traders, from beginners to more advanced participants looking for competitive pricing and tight bid\/ask spreads. This update aligns with Binance's strategy to continuously innovate and improve its trading environment, making it more accessible, efficient, and tailored to meet the diverse needs of its global user base. By enabling the Multi-Assets Mode by default for new futures accounts, Binance is taking a significant step towards simplifying the trading process, offering more flexibility, and enhancing the overall user experience on its platform.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Spanish Ministry of Finance, under the leadership of María Jesús Montero, is taking significant steps to enhance its control over cryptocurrencies within the country. The ministry is actively working on legislative reforms targeted at the General Tax Law, particularly focusing on Article 162. These reforms aim to empower the Spanish Tax Agency with the authority to identify and confiscate crypto assets from taxpayers who have pending tax debts. This move is part of a broader effort to combat tax evasion and align with the European Union's regulatory framework. A recent royal decree that came into effect on February 1 has expanded the scope of entities that can perform tax collection duties, extending beyond traditional banks to include electronic money institutions, which are now required to report all card transactions. This expansion is a clear indication of the Spanish government's commitment to tightening its grip on tax collection and ensuring compliance in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Additionally, Spain is preparing to adopt the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), the first comprehensive crypto framework by the European Union, by December 2025, six months ahead of the official deadline. This proactive stance highlights Spain's dedication to creating a robust regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Spanish residents with crypto assets on platforms outside Spain are obligated to declare these assets by the end of March 2024, with the declaration period for Form 721 having started on January 1, 2024. However, it's important to note that only individuals with crypto assets exceeding \u20AC50,000 are required to report their holdings. Those with self-custodied wallets must disclose their holdings through the standard wealth tax form 714. These developments come as countries worldwide are increasingly recognizing the need to tax cryptocurrency holdings amidst the market's expansion. Spain's efforts to enhance its cryptocurrency monitoring and taxation mechanisms are part of a global trend towards greater transparency and regulation of digital assets. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "articleSummary": "ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood reports a shift from traditional gold investments to Bitcoin, driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs and its increasing 'risk-off' role, especially during economic uncertainties like the regional bank crisis.",
        "creationDate": "2024-02-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a recent statement, Cathie Wood, Chief Executive Officer of ARK Invest, made the observation that there is a perceptible tendency of investors moving away from gold and toward Bitcoin. Considering the recent introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are based on spot Bitcoin, she believes that this pattern will continue. When there is a period of economic unpredictability, such as the regional bank crisis that took place in March 2023, when the value of Bitcoin soared by forty percent, Wood believes that Bitcoin is beginning to act more like an asset that is risk-off. It is especially clear that this is the case when there is uncertainty. Bitcoin has an inverse association with interest rates, but this move is connected to Bitcoin's growing connection with gold. This is despite the fact that Bitcoin has a connection with gold. Bitcoin's perception among investors has undergone a significant shift as a result of this development in comparison to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. This illustrates that ARK Invest has a strong faith in the value proposition of the cryptocurrency as well as its potential as a store of wealth by the fact that they have made this investment. As part of its aggressive strategy in the cryptocurrency market, ARK Invest has purchased shares in its own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that are now valued at $15.9 million. This action, which underlines ARK's commitment to Bitcoin and follows the trend, is a reflection of a bigger trend of increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. This sentiment is represented in this move. These events correlate with the period in time when the correlation between Bitcoin and gold has reached its highest peak. This is the point at which the correlation is at its highest point. This demonstrates that Bitcoin is becoming more and more recognized as a credible alternative to traditional safe haven instruments. In light of the fact that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have traditionally been characterized by their high degree of volatility and their emphasis on speculation, this move is significant since it signifies a significant shift in the market. Because of the emergence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the fact that institutional investors like ARK Invest are increasing their investments in cryptocurrencies, there is a growing belief that Bitcoin may provide a new investment opportunity for individuals who are interested in avoiding risk, particularly during times of economic instability. This belief is fueled by the fact that ARK Invest is leading the way in increasing its investments in cryptocurrencies. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "As a result of his arrest in March 2023 for trying to travel with falsified papers, Han Chang-joon, who had previously served as the Chief Financial Officer of Terraform Labs, was extradited from Montenegro to South Korea on February 5. The extradition is the completion of a legal procedure that started with Chang-joon's arrest at the Podgorica airport, along with Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, as they attempted to board an aircraft to Dubai using fake Costa Rican passports. The extradition brought about the culmination of the legal process. The two individuals were the subject of a search that lasted over six months around the globe. Before his extradition, Chang-joon was sentenced to four months in jail in Montenegro. His extradition was made possible by a decision made by the Ministry of Justice of Montenegro prior to his extradition. It is for the purpose of facing accusations relating to fraud in financial investment services, investments, and the capital market that he is returning to South Korea. There is a connection between these allegations and the collapse of the Terra blockchain in 2022, which resulted in a loss of sixty billion dollars. This event had a tremendous impact on the cryptocurrency sector, including the dissolution of important companies such as the cryptocurrency fund Three Arrows Capital and the exchange FTX. Do Kwon, on the other hand, is now facing extradition procedures to the United States, where he is accused with many felonies, including commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to deceive and participate in market manipulation. These various charges are listed in the extradition proceedings. The path that Kwon has taken through the judicial system has been defined by a variety of legal tactics. Although a court in Montenegro decided in December to extradite him to the United States, his extradition order is still pending. In addition to this new development, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed charges against Terraform Labs and Kwon in connection with the collapse of TerraUSD and Luna, which resulted in the loss of about $40 billion worth of investor money. By highlighting the worldwide legal hurdles and the intricacies involved in tackling fraud within the fast developing cryptocurrency industry, this case brings to light the importance of these issues. In addition to this, it illustrates the coordinated efforts of many nations in apprehending and extraditing persons who have been charged with substantial financial crimes, therefore establishing precedents for future cases in the digital asset arena.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-05",
        "detailedArticleContent": "With the intention of selling its 7.84% ownership in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence business that was valued at about $18 billion as of December 2023, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange known as FTX is requesting permission from the court to do so. According to estimates, the value of this investment is somewhere about $1.4 billion. Following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, this step is a part of the company's attempts to recover cash and completely reimburse consumers and creditors. Sam Bankman-Fried, who had previously served as the CEO of FTX, first used client deposits to make an investment of around $530 million in Anthropic via Alameda Research, which is a sister business of FTX. It was originally via this investment that Alameda was able to acquire a 13.56% share in Anthropic; however, following further fundraising rounds, this stake was reduced to 7.84%. FTX is attempting to have its sale motion reviewed in a shorter amount of time, with the goal of reaching a decision by the time a meeting of the bankruptcy court is set to take place on February 22, 2023. There is a strong chance for FTX to raise the monies required to satisfy its financial commitments and optimize returns for stakeholders via the sale of the Anthropic interest, which is seen as a major opportunity. For the purpose of making the sale easier, a number of other approaches, such as auctions or private discussions, are being investigated. This strategic disposal is in line with FTX's larger asset liquidation plan, which is designed to pay client commitments. Additionally, it highlights the company's commitment to indemnifying clients who have been negatively impacted. As part of a bigger attempt to liquidate assets, FTX is exploring the possibility of selling its share in Anthropic. Over the course of the previous three months, the company has sold more than 700 million dollars worth of cryptocurrencies, in addition to selling a significant amount of its GBTC investments for over 600 million dollars. In addition, the firm has taken steps to sell a claim against the defunct cryptocurrency lender Genesis, which is worth $175 million. This action demonstrates that the corporation is prioritizing the recovery of assets and the compensation of customers above the intentions to relaunch the exchange. According to the most recent information, FTX has been successful in amassing more than seven billion dollars' worth of recovered assets. The company intends to disperse these monies depending on the values of cryptocurrencies in November 2022, after the asset recovery phase has been completed.## Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-04",
        "detailedArticleContent": "FTX has initiated a significant legal maneuver by filing a motion in a Delaware court to sell its $175 million claim against Genesis Global Capital. This action comes in the wake of Genesis Global Capital declaring bankruptcy, with FTX and its associated hedge fund, Alameda Research, directly impacted. The claim, originally lodged by Alameda Research, forms a part of FTX's broader strategy to navigate its post-collapse financial recovery. FTX's move to sell the claim, either in full or in parts and potentially across different occasions, aims to optimize market conditions to maximize returns from the sale. The claims against Genesis are currently trading at 65% of their face value, a figure notably higher than the 38% value attributed to Alameda Research claims. FTX's motion outlines a proposed sales procedure designed to streamline the process, ensuring that the sale price is no less than 95% of the highest quoted price by leading market-makers for Genesis Global Capital's general unsecured claims within a specified timeframe around the sale date. This strategic decision underscores FTX's intent to alleviate the financial complexities and delays typically associated with the sale of such claims, highlighting the motion's rationale as being in the best interest of all parties involved, including debtors, creditors, and other stakeholders. The backdrop to this motion is FTX's initial effort to recoup $3.9 billion from Genesis under bankruptcy law provisions, a sum that was later negotiated down to $175 million in a settlement reached between the two entities in August 2023 and approved by the court in October of the same year. This settlement effectively extinguished other claims FTX had against Genesis, with both parties citing the unpredictable nature of potential recoveries and the desire to avoid lengthy and costly litigation as key reasons for the reduced claim amount. This development is part of a larger narrative involving FTX's collapse in November 2022 due to accounting irregularities, which sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. Genesis Global Capital, with $175 million tied up in FTX accounts at the time, insisted that this did not affect its market-making activities. However, Genesis's own bankruptcy filing in January 2023 and subsequent legal entanglements, notably with the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange over the Gemini Earn program, further complicate the situation. Genesis's recent $21 million settlement with the SEC over issues related to Gemini Earn is a critical element in its ongoing bankruptcy reorganization efforts. A court hearing scheduled for February 14 in New York will be a pivotal moment, as it will consider the inclusion of the SEC settlement in Genesis's proposed bankruptcy reorganization plan. This hearing represents a significant step in the unfolding legal drama surrounding Genesis Global Capital's bankruptcy and its broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry.

        "detailedArticleContent": "To combat the growing menace of cyber threats in the digital currency landscape, Singapore's Police Force and Cyber Security Agency have released a joint advisory cautioning the public about the surge in cryptocurrency drainers. These sophisticated pieces of malware are engineered to siphon off funds from unsuspecting users' digital wallets without their authorization. Cryptocurrency drainers exploit various techniques, including phishing scams, to deceive users into revealing their wallet keys or to unknowingly install malicious software. Once access is obtained, these drainers can drain funds from wallets, leaving users with significant losses and no straightforward recourse for recovery. The advisory highlights several critical recommendations for cryptocurrency users. Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of securing digital wallets with strong, unique passwords and the utilization of two-factor authentication wherever possible. Additionally, users are advised to remain vigilant against suspicious links or emails, which are common vectors for phishing attacks. The Singapore authorities' advisory also touches on the broader implications of such cyber threats. The rise of cryptocurrency drainers is not just a local issue but part of a global trend of increasing cyber attacks in the cryptocurrency space. This calls for heightened awareness and cooperation among international cybersecurity communities to mitigate these risks. Furthermore, the document outlines steps for users who believe they have been targeted by such malware. This includes immediately disconnecting the affected device from the internet, changing all security credentials, and reporting the incident to the authorities to aid in broader efforts to combat these cybercriminal activities. The advisory is a clear indicator of the Singapore government's commitment to ensuring the safety and security of its citizens in the digital age. By taking a proactive stance and educating the public about these threats, Singapore aims to foster a more secure and resilient digital finance ecosystem. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-02",
        "detailedArticleContent": "OPNX, a cryptocurrency exchange and bankruptcy claims platform co-founded by the individuals behind the failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), has announced it will cease operations and shut down by February 14, 2024. The announcement comes after the platform advised its users to settle their positions by February 7 and ensure all funds are withdrawn by February 14, post which the withdrawal functionality will be disabled. This decision marks the end of OPNX's operations, which aimed to facilitate the trading of creditor claims of bankrupt crypto companies. Just one week before the annoucement, Su Zhu, co-founder of collapsed Three Arrows Capital, said they will continue to promote exchange OPNX in Hong Kong according to SCMP. OPNX registered an office in Hong Kong's central business district in May last year, with former CoinFlex CEO Mark Lamb listed as a director. Hong Kong's new virtual asset regulatory rules has taken effect in June 2023. As a financial center, Hong Kong now welcome regulated crypto exchanges. The closure of OPNX is rooted in a series of regulatory challenges and financial penalties, which significantly impacted its operational capacity and financial stability. Despite efforts to navigate these issues, including securing a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in Lithuania, OPNX faced setbacks due to its association with controversial figures and heavy penalties from regulatory authorities, amounting to substantial financial burdens. Notably, the platform's ties to Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, co-founders of Three Arrows Capital, have particularly cast a shadow over its operations, attracting increased scrutiny and complicating its regulatory landscape. The platform's user base is strongly advised to adhere to the communicated deadlines for settling positions and withdrawing funds to avoid potential losses. This structured closure process highlights OPNX's commitment to ensuring a secure and orderly exit for its users amid its shutdown. The demise of OPNX underscores the volatile nature of the crypto market and the critical importance of regulatory compliance and operational transparency for platforms operating within this space. For the broader cryptocurrency industry, the closure of OPNX serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate challenges and regulatory pressures platforms can face. It also underscores the need for robust structures to support the growth and sustainability of the digital finance ecosystem. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "During the fourth quarter of 2023, Tether Holdings Limited achieved a record-breaking level of profitability, generating a net profit of $2.85 billion. This result may mostly be attributable to operational income of one billion dollars from US Treasuries, as well as gains from gold and Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, the firm made a strategic investment of $640 million in projects such as mining, artificial intelligence infrastructure, and peer-to-peer telecommunications, which resulted in a large rise in the company's surplus reserves, which reached $5.4 billion. The certification that Tether received from BDO, an internationally known auditing firm, demonstrates the company's dedication to maintaining financial stability and upholding transparency. BDO affirmed that the company's reserves are sufficient to repay all outstanding secured loans in full. It was in reaction to the concerns of the community over portfolio risks that this step was made. The total assets that were under the control of Tether topped $97 billion, with a significant percentage of those assets being invested in venture capital, Bitcoin, precious metals, and United States Treasuries. In the year 2023, Tether was able to produce a total net profit of $6.2 billion, with $4 billion coming from assets that were not related to cryptocurrency. These investments included US Treasury bonds. Tether is positioned as a solid and reputable organization within the cryptocurrency market as a result of this, which highlights the broad and strong financial approach that the company employs. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Executive Officer of the firm, stressed the company's commitment to liquidity and stability, underlining the strategic relevance of keeping a high proportion of reserves, which are comprised of cash and cash equivalents. Tether's operational success in 2023, which included the onboarding of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation for cooperation on monitoring and restraining unlawful activity, illustrates the company's pioneering position in establishing a financial environment that is both safe and inclusive. Tether's extensive financial and operational strategy may be examined via their most recent assurance opinion and the Consolidated Reserves Report.

This incident, first reported by 404 Media on January 31, 2024, brought to light the exposure of sensitive information including internal passwords, code, infrastructure diagrams, and technical details crucial for password and multi-factor authentication implementation at Binance. The leaked data, which was accessible on GitHub for months, included detailed infrastructure diagrams, internal passwords, and information on how Binance manages passwords and multi-factor authentication for customer accounts. Binance's initial reaction involved filing a copyright takedown request with GitHub to have the confidential data removed, citing \"a significant risk\" and potential \"severe financial harm\" to the company and confusion among its users. Despite the serious implications of the leak, Binance later claimed that the exposed data was outdated and posed a \"negligible risk\" to users. The exchange emphasized that the leaked information did not reflect its current operational protocols, suggesting that it would be unusable by malicious parties. Additionally, Binance is taking legal action against the individual responsible for posting the leaked data on GitHub, demonstrating its commitment to safeguarding its intellectual property and the security of its user base. This incident has raised significant concerns within the cryptocurrency community about the privacy and security risks associated with such leaks. While Binance has downplayed the risk to its users, the breach underscores the ongoing challenges of cybersecurity in the digital asset industry. It also highlights the importance of robust security measures and proactive risk mitigation strategies to protect sensitive information and maintain trust among users and stakeholders. The event has further implications, especially considering Binance's recent regulatory challenges, including a hefty fine over anti-money laundering violations. As the situation unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor how Binance addresses the breach's fallout and what measures it implements to prevent similar incidents in the future.

        "creationDate": "2024-02-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "FTX, once a leading name in the cryptocurrency exchange world, faced a tumultuous downfall in late 2022. The company's restructuring efforts in the aftermath of its bankruptcy filing have been closely scrutinized by investors, customers, and regulatory bodies. A recent development in FTX's bankruptcy case reveals a significant shift in the company's approach towards its creditors and customers. The primary focus of FTX's restructuring strategy, as articulated by the company's attorney Andrew Dietderich, is to fully repay the customers and creditors. This strategy marks a departure from earlier considerations of a potential relaunch of the exchange, labeled as FTX 2.0. However, Dietderich emphasized that this goal of full repayment is an objective, not a guarantee. One of the contentious aspects of this repayment plan is the valuation method for customer assets. FTX has decided to value customer claims based on cryptocurrency prices as of November 2022, the time when FTX filed for bankruptcy. This decision has not been well-received by a portion of FTX's customer base. The primary concern is that this valuation method does not reflect the current market value of cryptocurrencies, which have seen a significant rebound since their lows in 2022. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana, which are widely held by FTX customers, have experienced substantial price increases post-November 2022. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey has approved the method of valuing assets based on their November 2022 prices, aligning with the norms of U.S. bankruptcy law. This law stipulates that debts of a bankrupt entity should be tied to the date it filed for court protection. Despite customer objections, this decision stands as a legal precedent, similar to approaches adopted by other bankrupt crypto companies, including Celsius Network, BlockFi, and Voyager Digital. FTX's restructuring advisers are now tasked with the complex process of examining millions of claims filed against the exchange. This process aims to filter out illegitimate claims and determine the exact amounts owed to each creditor and customer. The ultimate objective is to establish a clear and fair system of repayment, adhering to legal and ethical standards. The FTX case, formally known as FTX Trading Ltd., U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, No. 22-11068, is being observed as a landmark in the crypto industry. It reflects not only the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets but also underscores the importance of robust financial and operational management in the crypto exchange industry. The implications of this case extend beyond the immediate stakeholders. They resonate throughout the global cryptocurrency community, impacting investor confidence and regulatory discourse surrounding digital assets. The outcome of this case could set significant precedents for how cryptocurrency exchanges operate and are regulated in the future. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-02-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The High Court of Singapore recently ruled against Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a bankrupt cryptocurrency hedge fund, in its attempt to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Arthur Cheong, the founder of Web3 investment firm DeFiance Capital. The court recognized a valid trust relationship between DeFiance Capital and 3AC, acknowledging that the assets in dispute were indeed held in trust for DeFiance Capital's investors. This decision stems from a lawsuit filed by Cheong in April 2023, wherein he contended that DeFiance Capital investors were the rightful beneficiaries of assets held by 3AC and that these funds should not be utilized to settle creditor claims against 3AC. The background to this legal battle traces back to an agreement between Cheong and 3AC founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies to launch an independent fund on the 3AC Group platform, which Cheong would own and control. This fund had access to 3AC resources and maintained segregated accounts and wallets under Cheong's name. Despite the collapse of 3AC in July 2022 and its subsequent bankruptcy, DeFiance Capital was allowed by the Singapore High Court to sue 3AC's estate to recover assets still under 3AC's control. The court found that the cryptocurrency in the Fireblocks wallets, which remained under 3AC's control, was held in trust, countering 3AC's claims that DeFiance Capital's claim was without merit. This ruling is significant for several reasons, not least of which is its affirmation of the trust relationship in the context of cryptocurrency assets and the jurisdiction of Singaporean courts in such disputes. It underscores the legal complexities surrounding the control and ownership of digital assets in the evolving crypto landscape. The decision also highlights the challenges faced by investors and fund managers in securing and asserting their rights over digital assets, especially in cases where the entities holding these assets go bankrupt.

The suit claims these parties provided substantial assistance to Hamas, spotlighting the challenges of regulating cryptocurrency in combating terrorism financing.",
        "creationDate": "2024-02-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Three families affected by the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 have taken legal action against a constellation of actors including the governments of Iran and Syria, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The lawsuit, lodged in the Southern District of New York, alleges that these defendants provided \"substantial assistance\" to the terrorist activities of Hamas, thereby implicating them in the devastation wrought on the victims and their families. This legal action represents a significant moment in the ongoing struggle against terrorism financing, especially in the context of the digital age where cryptocurrency platforms like Binance can be manipulated for illicit financial transactions. The lawsuit details how Binance allegedly facilitated financial activities for Hamas, including processing transactions that directly supported their terrorist operations between 2017 and mid-2023. This action raises critical questions about the adequacy of existing regulations and the responsibilities of digital financial platforms in monitoring and preventing the misuse of their services for terrorism financing. The case is particularly notable for highlighting the role of Iran and Syria, both designated by the U.S. as state sponsors of terrorism, in supporting Hamas' operations. The plaintiffs argue that these governments' material support was critical in enabling the October 7 attack, further complicating the geopolitical landscape surrounding terrorism financing and the responsibilities of nation-states in curbing such activities. Binance\u2019s recent settlement with the United States Department of Justice, which included Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations and a hefty $4.3 billion fine, underscores the lawsuit's allegations. This settlement, which came after Binance was accused of allowing illicit actors, including terrorist groups like Hamas, to bypass U.S. regulations, serves as a backdrop to the current legal challenge. The lawsuit, beyond seeking compensatory and punitive damages, shines a spotlight on the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks that can effectively address the challenges posed by the use of digital currencies in terrorism financing. It also emphasizes the critical responsibility of financial platforms in implementing stringent monitoring mechanisms to prevent their exploitation by terrorist entities. This case could potentially set a precedent for how similar cases are approached in the future, especially concerning the accountability of digital financial platforms and the role of nation-states in facilitating or combating terrorism financing. As the legal proceedings unfold, they will undoubtedly attract global attention, highlighting the complex interplay between technology, finance, and international security in the fight against terrorism.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-31",
        "detailedArticleContent": "China is gearing up to overhaul its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws, focusing significantly on cryptocurrency transactions. This move, set to be enacted by 2025, represents the first major amendment of the country's AML laws since their inception in 2007. The urgency of this reform was underscored at a recent State Council executive meeting chaired by Prime Minister Li Qiang, signaling the government's intensified focus on combating crypto money laundering crimes. The revision of the Anti-Money Laundering Law of the People's Republic of China was initially proposed in 2021 and is part of the 2023 legislative work plan. It aims to address the increasingly complex landscape of financial crimes, particularly those involving virtual assets. Legal experts have raised concerns about the challenges in framing regulations around crypto transactions, noting the ambiguity in the draft due to the lack of a clear definition of virtual assets. This lack of clarity poses difficulties in establishing operational guidelines for law enforcement and judicial bodies, potentially creating gray areas in combating the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering activities. Key changes in the amended AML law include a broader definition of money laundering activities, encompassing any efforts to conceal or disguise criminal income and its sources. The law also extends AML obligations to non-financial entities such as property developers, accounting firms, and precious metal exchanges. Moreover, it imposes AML responsibilities on all individuals and organizations, requiring them to report large cash transactions and adopt special preventive measures against listed targets involved in terrorism or money laundering. Significantly, the amended law also introduces higher penalties for AML violations, with fines up to CNY 200,000 for failure in adopting special preventive measures. Additionally, the law sets reciprocal requirements for international AML cooperation, restricting Chinese financial institutions from complying with foreign orders involving the seizure or transfer of assets without government approval. This legislative move is in response to the global trend of digital currencies and the associated risks of money laundering. China's approach indicates a commitment to align with international practices and establish a risk-based approach to AML\/CTF (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) efforts. However, the draft version of the law may still undergo changes before finalization. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-31",
        "detailedArticleContent": "German authorities have seized a record-breaking amount of Bitcoin, valued at approximately \u20AC2 billion ($2.17 billion). This event, involving the Saxony State Criminal Police Office and other German law enforcement agencies, marks the largest cryptocurrency seizure in Germany's history. The seizure of 50,000 Bitcoins was part of a broader investigation into alleged copyright violations and unauthorized commercial exploitation of copyrighted works. The Bitcoins were linked to two individuals, a German and a Polish national, accused of operating a piracy website until the end of 2013. The authorities suspect that these individuals purchased the Bitcoins using proceeds from the pirated materials distributed through their website. Interestingly, the suspects voluntarily transferred the Bitcoins to official wallets of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), although the future utilization of these seized cryptocurrencies remains undetermined. This development raises questions about the potential impact on the cryptocurrency market, considering the significant amount of Bitcoin involved. This seizure is notable not only for its size but also for the cooperation between various agencies, including the Dresden General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), the FBI, and a Munich-based forensic IT expert company. It underscores the increasing focus of law enforcement on the intersection of cryptocurrency and illegal activities, particularly in the context of copyright violations and money laundering. The event is part of a larger trend where authorities worldwide are intensifying their efforts to regulate and monitor cryptocurrency transactions, particularly those linked to illegal activities. This operation also highlights the growing sophistication of law enforcement in tracing and seizing digital assets, a significant development in the ongoing debate about the regulation and use of cryptocurrencies. As the investigation continues, further details may emerge about the implications of this seizure for both the individuals involved and the broader cryptocurrency market. For now, this remains a landmark case in the history of cryptocurrency enforcement in Germany. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-31",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Japan is actively stepping up its efforts towards issuing a digital yen, a central bank digital currency (CBDC), aligning with global trends in digital currency development. This move signifies a significant shift in Japan's financial landscape, responding to both domestic needs and international advancements in this arena. In recent years, the concept of CBDCs has gained momentum globally, with various countries exploring and implementing their versions. Japan, traditionally known for its cash-centric economy, is now making notable strides in this direction. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Japanese government are working collaboratively to address the feasibility and legalities of a digital yen. Pilot Program and Expert Panel As reported in early 2023, the BoJ plans to launch a pilot program in April to test the practicalities of a digital yen. This follows the completion of the initial phase of experiments by March 2023. Parallelly, the finance ministry is establishing an expert panel as early as April to discuss and resolve legal issues surrounding CBDC issuance. Global Context and Comparison Japan's move towards a digital currency comes at a time when several countries, including China, the European Union, and the United States, are exploring similar initiatives. China, in particular, is at the forefront of the CBDC race, having already implemented pilot schemes for retail payments. In contrast, Japan aims to ensure the coexistence of CBDCs with various forms of money and to address personal data storage minimization. Implications for Japan's Economy The introduction of a digital yen could revolutionize Japan's financial system, known for its reliance on cash transactions. It could enhance the efficiency of domestic and international payments, thereby modernizing the financial system. This move also indicates Japan's recognition of the growing importance of digital currencies in the global economy. Future Outlook While the launch of a digital yen is not yet officially confirmed, the pilot program and the formation of the expert panel are critical steps towards this goal. The BoJ has indicated that any decision to issue a CBDC will only be taken after comprehensive national discussions, expected to continue at least until 2026. Japan's cautious yet progressive approach towards a digital yen reflects its desire to stay competitive in the evolving global financial landscape while addressing domestic preferences and legal considerations.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-30",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has approved its first-ever spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This groundbreaking move follows in the footsteps of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had previously approved a spot BTC ETF in the US. The application for the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETF was submitted by Harvest Hong Kong, one of China's most prominent fund managers, on January 26. The approval signifies a major step forward in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system, especially within the Asian markets. The SFC's decision to expedite the approval process for this ETF, right after the Chinese New Year celebrations, indicates a growing recognition of the importance of digital assets in the global financial landscape. The decision by the SFC is particularly noteworthy given the previously cautious stance of Asian regulatory bodies towards cryptocurrencies. This approval could potentially pave the way for more widespread acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies in traditional investment portfolios across the region. Looking at the broader implications, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by major regulatory bodies like the SEC and now the SFC is indicative of a maturing market and increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are considered a more direct investment in Bitcoin compared to futures-based ETFs, as they require actual purchase of the underlying asset. This can provide a more accurate reflection of Bitcoin's market value and can be seen as a vote of confidence in the stability and longevity of the cryptocurrency. The move also represents a shift in the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates a growing understanding and acceptance of digital assets by regulatory authorities, which could lead to more structured and comprehensive regulatory frameworks in the future. This is crucial for the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency market, as clear regulations can attract more institutional investors and boost investor confidence. However, it's important to note that the cryptocurrency market is still relatively young and volatile. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency-related financial products. The approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is a significant development, but it comes with the usual risks associated with digital asset investments. In conclusion, the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission marks a significant development in the cryptocurrency world. It not only reflects the growing institutional interest in digital assets but also signifies a major step towards the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial ecosystem. As the market continues to evolve, we can expect to see more developments in this space, potentially leading to a more robust and mature cryptocurrency market. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Stellar (XLM) Development Foundation (SDF) has decided to postpone the vote on Protocol 20, initially scheduled for January 30, due to a bug discovered in Stellar Core v20.1.0. This decision came after the SDF received feedback from various participants in the Stellar ecosystem, including contract developers, wallet developers, validators, and tools builders. The bug, identified on January 25, 2024, affects fee-bump transactions for Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain. It could potentially impact applications and services that use fee bumps for Soroban transactions if the Mainnet upgrades to Protocol 20. While the SDF initially assessed the risk posed by the bug as minimal, they later decided to delay the upgrade in response to the ecosystem's feedback and the need for a broad consensus. The SDF has \"disarmed\" its validators to prevent them from voting for the upgrade on the planned date. However, it's important to note that the decision to upgrade does not solely rest with the SDF. Other validators on the Stellar network may still choose to vote for the Protocol 20 upgrade on the scheduled date. A quorum is required by the voting validators for the Protocol 20 upgrade to pass. Protocol 20 is a significant upgrade for the Stellar network, aiming to introduce smart contract functionality through a phased rollout of the Soroban platform, which is a smart contract platform that went live on a Stellar testnet in October 2022. The SDF also launched a $100 million fund to attract developers to the platform at that time. The SDF plans to coordinate with validators to determine a new upgrade date once a new version of Stellar Core containing the bug fix is available, which is expected within the next two weeks. The Stellar blockchain currently hosts over 40 validator nodes, and a validator quorum will be required for any future upgrade proposal. This delay is a careful step by the SDF to ensure the stability and reliability of the Stellar network as it introduces significant protocol changes. The commitment to involving the community and validators in these decisions highlights the collaborative nature of blockchain governance. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) raised concerns about the increasing number of cryptocurrency scams that exploit Artificial Intelligence (AI). This advisory, titled \"Customer Advisory: AI Won\u2019t Turn Trading Bots into Money Machines,\" aims to educate investors about the deceptive tactics used by fraudsters and to prevent financial losses in such schemes. The CFTC's warning comes amid a significant upsurge in AI-related scams in the crypto sector. Scammers have been promoting AI-powered trading bots and algorithms that promise unrealistic returns. The rise of social media influencers in promoting these dubious schemes further complicates the issue, as they often spread false information about the capabilities of AI in trading. AI technology, despite its advancements, cannot predict future changes in crypto or financial markets. The CFTC's statement serves as a reality check against claims that suggest AI can guarantee profits or foresee market movements. This is a critical point for investors to understand, as AI's limitations in this context are often overshadowed by the hype surrounding its potential. A notable case highlighted by the CFTC involves a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Cornelius Johannes Steynberg, which defrauded individuals of over $1.7 billion in Bitcoins. This case, among others, illustrates the methods scammers use, such as leveraging AI technology to create an illusion of high-tech sophistication in their fraudulent schemes. The CFTC encourages investors to be vigilant and to conduct thorough research before investing in AI-driven trading bots or platforms. It is essential to verify the background of any company or trader before entrusting funds to them. The CFTC also stresses the importance of reporting suspicious activities or information to foster transparency and accountability in the sector. In light of these developments, it's clear that the world of AI-driven crypto scams is not limited to Ponzi schemes. Various tactics are employed by cybercriminals, ranging from creating deepfakes, hijacking YouTube channels, to executing \"Double Your Crypto\" scams. This diversity in tactics underscores the sophistication and evolving nature of these scams. The CFTC's Customer Advisory is a crucial step in educating and reminding investors of the potential risks in the rapidly evolving crypto market. With AI-driven crypto scams infiltrating even the stock market, the advisory's role in fostering investor awareness and caution cannot be overstated. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The ongoing criminal trial of Julius Aleksanteri Kivimäki in Finland has been marked by significant developments involving cryptocurrency tracking. Kivimäki stands accused of hacking into the database of Vastaamo, a private mental health firm, and demanding ransom payments in cryptocurrencies. This high-profile case has brought to light the complexities of dealing with crimes involving digital currencies, especially those designed for privacy. In October 2022, Kivimäki allegedly demanded a ransom of 40 Bitcoin, approximately 450,000 euros at the time, threatening to release records of over 33,000 patients from Vastaamo. When his demands were not met, Kivimäki reportedly targeted individual patients. The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation has played a pivotal role in tracing the Monero transactions connected to this case, a notable achievement given Monero's reputation for strong privacy features, including Ring Confidential Transactions and stealth addresses. Investigators found that Kivimäki received payments in Bitcoin, then transferred these funds to an exchange that did not adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. He subsequently converted these funds to Monero and moved them to a dedicated Monero wallet. Interestingly, it appears that the funds were later transferred to Binance, converted back to Bitcoin, and then distributed to various wallets. However, the authorities have maintained confidentiality regarding the specifics of their on-chain analysis. This case underscores the challenges law enforcement faces in tracking transactions involving privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, which are designed to be untraceable and anonymize users completely. The ability to follow the crypto trail in this instance is significant and might set a precedent for future investigations involving privacy coins. The case of Julius Aleksanteri Kivimäki highlights the evolving landscape of cybercrime, where digital currencies play a central role, and the ongoing efforts by law enforcement agencies to adapt and respond to these challenges. The implications of this trial extend beyond the immediate case, touching on broader issues of cryptocurrency regulation, privacy, and the balance between individual freedoms and the need for security and law enforcement efficacy.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Algorand (ALGO) Foundation has recently faced an unprecedented challenge. Staci Warden, the CEO of the Algorand Foundation, became the target of a severe cyber attack, with her social media account being compromised. For over 15 hours, unidentified individuals posted racial slurs and derogatory remarks, not only tarnishing the reputation of the Foundation but also raising questions about the security measures in place. The incident highlights the persistent vulnerability of high-profile individuals in the digital domain, particularly in the sensitive and high-stakes world of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Despite the Algorand Foundation's prompt response and recovery efforts, the attackers managed to hold control over the account, using it to mock followers and undermine the platform's integrity. This situation brings to light the broader implications of cybersecurity in the blockchain industry. Algorand, known for its technological advancements and contributions to the blockchain ecosystem, now faces a critical test of its operational and security protocols. The incident could have ripple effects across the sector, prompting other organizations to reassess their security measures. The persistent nature of this attack raises several questions. Firstly, the identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Are they merely online trolls, or do they represent a more sinister threat to the blockchain industry? Secondly, the effectiveness of existing security measures for high-profile individuals in the tech world is under scrutiny. How can industry leaders bolster their defenses against such breaches? Staci Warden's ordeal is not an isolated incident. In recent years, several tech executives and cryptocurrency leaders have faced similar cyber attacks. This pattern underscores the need for stronger, more resilient cybersecurity measures in the industry. The Algorand Foundation's experience serves as a cautionary tale for other organizations in the digital finance sector. In conclusion, the cyber attack on Staci Warden's social media account is more than just a personal violation; it's a wake-up call for the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the need for robust security frameworks and proactive measures to protect individuals and organizations from such malicious activities. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-26",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The US government is set to auction over $130 million in Bitcoin, previously seized in the high-profile Silk Road investigation, marking a significant move in the handling of digital assets linked to criminal activities. In a recent decision by the US District Court for the District of Maryland, 2,874.9 BTC (valued at around $129 million) and an additional 58.7 BTC (approximately $3.3 million) were cleared for sale. This action follows the court-approved forfeiture of 69,000 BTC connected to the Silk Road case, a notorious digital black market. The Silk Road, operational from 2011 until its shutdown in 2013, was a digital marketplace infamous for facilitating illegal activities like drug trades and money laundering using Bitcoin. The seized Bitcoin stems from the criminal activities of individuals like Ryan Farace and Sean Bridges. Farace was involved in a money laundering conspiracy linked to the sale of Xanax on darknet marketplaces, while Bridges, a former US Secret Service Special Agent, was deeply involved in the Silk Road investigations and subsequently found guilty of stealing Bitcoin. The auction includes two lots of Bitcoin. The first, approximately 2,800 BTC, is valued at roughly $129 million, while the second, smaller lot consists of 58 BTC worth about $3 million. The bitcoins were linked to Farace, who was sentenced to 54 months in prison on a charge of money laundering conspiracy. Alongside his father, Joseph Farace, they were found guilty of attempting to transfer over 2,874 Bitcoin to a foreign bank account. Shaun Bridges, another figure in this story, was a member of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force and was sentenced to a six-year prison term for the theft of BTC during the US government's investigation of the Silk Road. This move represents a significant step in the US government's approach to handling digital assets derived from criminal activities. The US Attorney General will oversee the sale, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory standards. This initiative not only reflects the government's efforts in combating crime related to digital currencies but also sets a precedent for future actions involving cryptocurrencies. The sale of these Bitcoins is not just a mere transaction but symbolizes a broader narrative in the digital age \u2013 the intersection of digital innovation, crime, and law enforcement. It highlights the evolving landscape of digital currencies and the continuous effort of law enforcement agencies to adapt and respond to crimes in this sphere. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-26",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The UK's journey towards potentially introducing a digital pound, colloquially termed \"Britcoin,\" has entered a new phase. The Bank of England (BoE) and HM Treasury published their response to the digital pound consultation on January 25, 2024, signifying a cautious yet progressive approach towards exploring a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the UK. This development follows a consultation launched in February 2023, seeking public and industry input. Over 50,000 responses were received, highlighting concerns about user privacy, control of funds, and access to cash. Privacy and Legislation A key outcome of the consultation is the commitment to user privacy. The BoE and HM Treasury have assured that neither institution would access users' personal data in the proposed digital pound system. Primary legislation would guarantee user privacy and control, ensuring transparency and public trust. Maintaining Cash Access In parallel, the commitment to maintaining access to physical cash has been reaffirmed. The authorities recognize the ongoing relevance of cash, particularly for segments of the population who depend on it. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is also set to publish a new regulatory framework by summer 2024 to protect access to cash. Design and Features The digital pound would aim to complement cash, providing an alternative for digital transactions. It would be equivalent in value to physical currency, accessible via digital wallets, and initially introduced with holding limits. Notably, it would not offer interest, differentiating it from traditional savings accounts. Skepticism and Future Steps Despite these assurances, skepticism remains. Concerns about privacy and the potential impact on financial stability persist, particularly regarding bank runs during crises. The Treasury Committee and various industry stakeholders have called for more detailed plans and clearer timelines. The next steps involve further research and design considerations. Following this, a decision will be made on whether to proceed with the digital pound. If affirmative, a timeline for additional consultations and potential launch will be established, though not expected before 2025. The UK's exploration of a digital pound comes amid a global shift towards digital currencies. Countries worldwide are evaluating CBDCs, each with unique approaches to privacy, access, and integration with existing financial systems. Conclusion The UK's cautious yet forward-looking approach towards a potential digital pound reflects the complexities of introducing a CBDC. Balancing innovation with privacy, security, and traditional banking practices remains a challenging yet essential endeavor. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-25",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Dr. Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has made a significant move by offering a settlement to the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) and other key parties in the ongoing legal confrontations over Bitcoin. This move comes amidst his efforts to assert his claims over Bitcoin's original vision and its decentralized nature. Wright's settlement proposal, outlined in a letter published on his personal blog, suggests waiving his database rights and copyrights related to BTC, BCH, and ABC databases, offering an irrevocable license to his opposing parties. The central claim revolves around the decentralization of Bitcoin, a core principle Wright emphasizes as being threatened by potential centralization from entities like Meta. The settlement terms also include a demand that COPA and others refrain from creating, copying, or forking Bitcoin, and publicly acknowledge the cryptocurrency's intended purpose as per Wright's interpretation. The response from the crypto community has been mixed, with some seeing the offer as an attempt by Wright to reinforce his claim as Satoshi Nakamoto and steer Bitcoin's future. Critics argue that Wright's actions could be construed as an effort to centralize control over Bitcoin, contradicting the cryptocurrency's decentralized ethos. However, Wright's focus remains on the fixed, immutable protocol of Bitcoin, which he argues is key to maintaining its decentralized nature. He stresses that the stability of this protocol ensures that no single individual or group can unilaterally alter Bitcoin's fundamental aspects. This perspective aligns with his broader argument against extensible systems, which he believes could lead to power dynamics undermining decentralization. The essence of Wright's argument lies in the immutability of Bitcoin\u2019s protocol, which he views as critical for preserving its decentralized structure. This resistance to changes, he posits, is what differentiates Bitcoin from more flexible systems where rules and protocols are susceptible to alterations by limited parties. In response to the settlement offer, members of COPA and other involved parties must decide whether to engage in settlement discussions or continue the legal battle. They have until 4pm on January 31st to review and accept or deny Wright's offer. The outcome of this settlement offer and the ongoing debates over decentralization in the crypto world underscore the complex dynamics at play in the governance and future direction of Bitcoin and similar digital currencies.

She reintroduces the Lummis-Gillibrand bill to enhance oversight and protect against abuse, stressing the distinction between innovative crypto assets and illicit activities.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-25",
        "detailedArticleContent": "U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has recently reaffirmed her support for the cryptocurrency industry, underscoring that the primary issue lies with bad actors, not the assets themselves. This stance was highlighted during a heated exchange with Senator Elizabeth Warren over the financial implications of cryptocurrencies compared to traditional fiat currencies. She stated, $900 million in non-crypto (fiat currency) money laundering vs $900,000 in crypto money laundering. Crypto is clearly not the problem. Criminals and bad actors are. It would be a historic mistake to crush an entire emerging industry based on incorrect data. Senator Lummis, a known advocate for the crypto sector, emphasized the necessity of distinguishing between the innovative potential of crypto assets and the illicit activities conducted by some within the space. In a recent Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing, she passionately argued for the establishment of a robust regulatory framework, criticizing the prevailing \u201Cstatus quo\u201D that leaves businesses with unclear rules and consumers vulnerable. The Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, reintroduced by Senator Lummis, aims to provide a comprehensive regulatory perimeter for crypto assets. This legislation focuses on combating the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities, introducing new penalties for violations, and safeguarding against the misuse of crypto for illicit purposes. In her statement, Senator Lummis highlighted a significant disparity in money laundering activities, citing that traditional fiat currencies have been used to launder over $900 million, far exceeding the $900,000 linked to cryptocurrencies. This comparison was drawn to argue against overly stringent regulations that might stifle the growth of an emerging industry based on misinformed perceptions. The debate on Capitol Hill, particularly between Senators Lummis and Warren, sheds light on the differing views regarding cryptocurrencies' role in money laundering. Senator Warren, citing a case involving the Sinaloa Cartel, called for stricter cryptocurrency regulations. In contrast, Senator Lummis pointed out that the same cartel had previously laundered a substantial amount through fiat currencies, indicating that the issue is not with the crypto assets but with the criminals exploiting any financial system. Senator Lummis\u2019 efforts in advocating for a clear regulatory framework have garnered support from industry experts who agree that effective regulations are crucial for preventing exploitation of the system by bad actors. These regulations would also provide stability and certainty for investors and businesses involved in the crypto sector. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the actions and decisions of policymakers like Senator Lummis will play a pivotal role in shaping its future. In conclusion, Senator Lummis\u2019 defense of the crypto industry against undue criticism and her push for thoughtful, comprehensive regulations highlight the importance of balancing innovation with security. Her efforts aim to create a regulatory environment that is conducive to the growth of legitimate crypto enterprises while effectively weeding out unlawful activities. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-25",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on BlackRock's proposed spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that echoes the regulator's cautious approach toward cryptocurrency-based investment products. This decision, announced just a day before the initial deadline of January 25, 2024, marks a significant moment in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation and investment. The application for the iShares Ethereum Trust was filed by Nasdaq on behalf of BlackRock on November 21, 2023, and was published for comment in the Federal Register on December 11, 2023. The SEC, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act, had a 45-day window to make a decision, which could be extended up to 90 days if deemed necessary. The Commission has now designated March 10, 2024, as the new deadline to either approve, disapprove, or initiate proceedings to ascertain the appropriateness of the proposed rule change. This delay is part of a broader trend of postponements by the SEC concerning cryptocurrency ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that such delays are expected to continue sporadically over the coming months, with significant attention focused on May 23rd as a key date for further decisions on spot Ether ETF applications. The SEC's cautious stance is indicative of the broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. While some industry insiders like Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, remain optimistic about eventual approval, others like Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko express skepticism, citing the SEC's generally hostile attitude toward the crypto industry. The implications of these delays are far-reaching. Investors and market watchers are keenly observing the SEC's moves, as they could set precedents for future cryptocurrency-related financial products. The decision-making process also highlights the ongoing debate about the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies as securities, a topic that has been at the forefront of discussions in the crypto and financial sectors. In conclusion, the SEC's postponement of its decision on BlackRock's Ethereum ETF reflects the regulator's careful approach in dealing with crypto-based investment products. This move, while causing a stir in the cryptocurrency community, underscores the need for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to navigate the complex and evolving world of digital assets.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-25",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Nexo, a cryptocurrency lending platform, has taken a significant legal step against the Republic of Bulgaria, seeking $3 billion in damages. This arbitration claim, filed through the World Bank\u2019s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in Washington, D.C., centers around allegations that Bulgaria engaged in wrongful and politically motivated actions against the company. The origins of this conflict trace back to an investigation launched by Bulgarian prosecutors in early 2023. Nexo's offices were raided over allegations of participation in an organized criminal group aimed at profiting from crypto lending. Four Bulgarian nationals, including Nexo co-founders Kosta Kanchev, Antoni Trenchev, Trayan Nikolov, and Kalin Metodiev, were charged following these raids. However, in December 2023, the case was dropped due to a lack of evidence and Bulgaria's absence of a legal framework for crypto assets. Nexo alleges that the investigation was baseless and has had a severe impact on its business operations and reputation. The company claims it was in the process of working with U.S. banks on an initial public offering (IPO), with a valuation estimated between $8 and $12 billion. Additionally, Nexo was reportedly close to finalizing a sponsorship deal with a major European football club, which would have significantly boosted its global exposure. Both of these lucrative opportunities were lost due to the investigation. Apart from these setbacks, Nexo also faced legal challenges in the United States. The company agreed to a $45 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) over its Earn Interest Product. This led to Nexo discontinuing the product in April and eventually winding down its U.S. operations, citing a lack of regulatory clarity. Nexo's legal team, led by U.S. law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, argues that the investigation by Bulgarian authorities was unjustified and oppressive, leading to significant financial and reputational damage. The claim, filed by Nexo's Swiss subsidiary Nexo AG, seeks to recover lost opportunities and damages caused by the allegations. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "OKX Ventures, the investment arm of the prominent crypto exchange and Web3 technology company OKX, has recently announced a strategic investment in Orbiter Finance, a decentralized cross-Layer 2 (L2) protocol. This marks a significant step in the evolution of blockchain infrastructure and decentralization efforts. Orbiter Finance, known for its transformative product enhancements, is currently developing a zero-knowledge (ZK) technology-based, omni-chain rollup on Ethereum. This initiative is expected to redefine Orbiter Finance's vision, elevating it beyond its original role as an asset cross-rollup bridge. In the past two years, Orbiter Finance has impressively processed over 12 million transactions, with a total transaction volume exceeding US$7.8 billion. The protocol has garnered a substantial user base of over three million and a community of more than 700,000 users and fans. In 2024, Orbiter Finance is set to bring considerable changes to the blockchain space, establishing itself as a ZK-tech-based, instant omni-chain rollup on Ethereum. A notable feature of the protocol is the integration of ZK Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) to authenticate L2 transactions on the mainnet and to address fraudulent re-layers via the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This development introduces a secure, efficient, low-cost, and quick communication mechanism for Ethereum. The fund security provided by ZK-SPV enables Orbiter Finance to extend complete access to the 'Maker' role, thereby achieving a critical milestone in blockchain infrastructure\u2014decentralization. Dora Yue, the Founder of OKX Ventures, expressed excitement about leading the strategic investment in Orbiter Finance. She highlighted the protocol's ability to overcome traditional bridge limitations, such as speed, and its role in enhancing the efficiency of cross-chaining between various L2s and the Ethereum mainnet. Orbiter Finance currently supports over 19 L2 rollups and numerous native Ethereum assets, positioning it as a crucial infrastructure component for the L2 ecosystem. Yue commended the team's continuous product upgrades and their commitment to ensuring a more decentralized and trustless support for the L2 ecosystem's growth in 2024. OKX Ventures, with an initial capital commitment of USD 100 million, focuses on exploring the best blockchain projects globally, supporting cutting-edge blockchain technology innovation, and investing in long-term structural value. Through its support for entrepreneurs contributing to the blockchain industry, OKX Ventures aims to build innovative companies and provide global resources and historical experience to blockchain projects.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Michael Wang, President of ACE Exchange, has been arrested on allegations of fraud and money laundering. The arrest, which occurred earlier this month, has sent shockwaves through the industry, especially considering Wang's notable status as a leader within a major crypto exchange. The Taiwanese authorities have detained Wang following accusations that he was involved in a scheme promoting worthless cryptocurrencies, essentially engaging in a fraudulent activity known as the \"junk coin scam.\" This development follows the earlier arrest of ACE Exchange founder David Pan, who was also implicated in planning fraud and luring investors to invest in these worthless cryptocurrencies through social media ads. Law enforcement agencies conducted a thorough search of Wang's residence, uncovering around 49 million New Taiwan dollars in cash and nearly 190 million New Taiwan dollars' worth of cryptocurrencies. In addition, a McLaren 720S supercar, valued at 18 million New Taiwan dollars, was seized from his girlfriend's home. These findings have raised concerns about potential money laundering activities linked to Wang and the exchange. Wang, who has denied involvement in the case, claimed that the suspicious funds were borrowed from friends. However, his inability to explain the source of the funds led to his arrest and further investigation by the authorities. This incident raises significant concerns for users of ACE Exchange. The financial regulator has warned that the exchange could be delisted from the list of compliant exchanges, and users are advised to withdraw their tokens and deposits as a precaution. The exchange's cash custody is managed by KGI Bank, ensuring the safety of users' cash reserves, but the custody of the cryptocurrencies is a matter of concern. The crypto market, while often celebrated for its innovation and growth, has also been marred by instances of fraud and regulatory scrutiny. The arrest of a high-profile figure like Michael Wang not only highlights the risks associated with the industry but also underscores the need for greater oversight and consumer protection.

This move marks a significant step in EDX Markets' growth trajectory, following a successful second funding round co-led by Pantera Capital and Sequoia Capital. Although the exact funding size remains undisclosed, the investment enthusiasm is evident as shares were purchased at double their initial 2022 value. EDX Markets' foray into Singapore is not just a geographic expansion; it's a strategic diversification of its product offerings. The company plans to introduce spot and perpetual futures trading, catering to a wide array of investors and traders in the dynamic Asian financial hub. Singapore's robust financial ecosystem and its open-arms approach to fintech innovation make it an ideal location for EDX Markets to diversify its product suite and tap into a rich pool of financial talent. This expansion is underpinned by the launch of EDX Clearing, a cutting-edge, non-custodial clearing solution for digital asset trading. This feature significantly elevates EDX's marketplace, offering a competitive edge by enabling a single net settlement process through EDXC. This innovation not only reduces credit risk but also streamlines the trading process, thereby attracting more institutional investors. The company's approach to custody is another aspect worth noting. In a market where custodial services are a hot topic, EDX Markets has chosen to partner with Anchorage Digital for custodial services, ensuring that users can trade without the need for pre-funding in fiat or cryptocurrency. This non-custodial model is a strategic move to mitigate the risks associated with fund co-mingling, making the platform more attractive to cautious institutional investors. EDX Markets' expansion into Singapore and its innovative product offerings are set against the backdrop of a recovering cryptocurrency market. The platform is poised to offer institutional investors a robust venue for trading major tokens like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin, without the typical custodial concerns. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "articleSummary": "A recent FINRA review reveals over 70% of crypto-related retail communications from member firms contain potential violations of regulatory guidelines, including false or misleading claims.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-24",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has identified a staggering rate of potential regulatory violations. In a targeted exam initiated in November 2022, FINRA reviewed over 500 retail communications related to crypto assets from member firms. The findings, disclosed in January 2024, reveal that approximately 70% of these communications potentially violated FINRA's Rule 2210, which governs communications with the public. Rule 2210 is a cornerstone regulation that ensures fairness and balance in broker-dealer communications. It prohibits false, exaggerated, promissory, unwarranted, or misleading claims, and demands that any communication provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts regarding any product or service discussed. The rule is critical in maintaining market integrity and protecting investors from misleading information. The violations identified by FINRA primarily involve misleading statements and comparisons about crypto assets. These include false implications that crypto assets function like cash or equivalent instruments, unclear and misleading explanations of crypto assets' operations, and comparisons of crypto assets with other assets, like stocks or cash, without a sound basis. Notably, some communications falsely suggested that crypto assets were protected by federal securities laws or FINRA rules, or misleadingly stated the extent to which certain crypto assets are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). This review is part of FINRA's ongoing efforts to regulate the burgeoning crypto market. It comes in the wake of increased interest in crypto assets and the potential harm caused by problematic communications in this rapidly evolving market. The findings underscore the need for member firms to rigorously adhere to regulatory standards, especially in a market as volatile and complex as cryptocurrencies. FINRA's report is more than a mere compilation of compliance issues; it serves as a vital tool for member firms to refine their communication strategies. The high rate of non-compliance in crypto communications highlights the need for heightened vigilance and adherence to regulatory standards. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, FINRA's oversight and subsequent regulatory actions will play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of cryptocurrency and its integration into the broader financial system. FINRA's findings are a stark reminder of the growing pains of the crypto industry and the importance of rigorous oversight. The organization's role may be further influenced by an upcoming Supreme Court decision regarding the SEC's use of in-house judges, which could have repercussions for FINRA's own practices. This decision follows a 2023 ruling by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit against FINRA's use of these judges. In summary, the report from FINRA serves as a critical reminder of the challenges facing the crypto industry and the importance of maintaining high standards of regulatory compliance. As the crypto market continues to grow and attract investor interest, the role of regulatory bodies like FINRA in ensuring market integrity and investor protection becomes increasingly vital.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-24",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Avalanche Foundation, an influential supporter of the Avalanche blockchain, has introduced a distinctive eligibility framework for meme coin acquisitions. This initiative is part of the Foundation's broader strategy to foster cultural engagement and community building within the cryptocurrency sphere. The Foundation aims to purchase meme coins using funds from its $100 million \"Culture Catalyst\" program, which supports various cultural initiatives. Meme coins, known for their humorous and often dog-themed nature, have gained popularity despite their volatile and occasionally dubious value. Some meme coins have emerged as legitimate investment opportunities, while others have been marred by scams and fraudulent activities. The Foundation's approach seeks to encourage projects that not only entertain but also foster a sense of community belonging and engagement. Moreover, this strategy promotes a diverse and inclusive ecosystem within the blockchain space. The eligibility framework outlined by the Avalanche Foundation is designed to ensure the selection of meme coins that demonstrate stability, security, and substantial community support. To be considered for acquisition, meme coins must meet specific criteria: Independence from Creators: Meme coins must be independent from their creators and native to the Avalanche blockchain. Tokens reserved for creators' teams or replicated on other blockchains are excluded. Ownership and Distribution: The creators must renounce ownership of the mint contract. The framework requires a minimum of 2,000 unique token holders, with the top 100 holders owning less than 60% of the total supply. Liquidity and Market Cap: A liquidity pool of over $200,000, provided by at least 50 liquidity providers, is necessary. The meme coin should have a minimum market capitalization of $1 million. Trading Volume and Lifespan: An average daily trading volume of at least $100,000 on Avalanche DEXes for at least two weeks is required. Additionally, the meme coin must have been in existence for at least a month. This structured approach is aimed at bringing transparency and legitimacy to the meme coin market. The Foundation views meme coins and similar tokens as \"community coins,\" reflecting the creativity, culture, and camaraderie within the blockchain community. The criteria, while subject to change at the Foundation's discretion, are a crucial step in identifying meme coins that demonstrate genuine community engagement, value, and long-term viability. The Avalanche Foundation's move into the meme coin sector signifies an interesting evolution in the cryptocurrency landscape, recognizing the unique cultural and entertainment value these tokens can offer. This initiative is a testament to the growing importance of meme coins in the broader crypto ecosystem and the potential they hold in shaping the future of digital currencies and blockchain technology.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-24",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Kaspersky Labs has uncovered a sophisticated malware campaign targeting MacOS users who download pirated apps. The malware specifically targets newer operating systems, macOS versions 13.6 and above, and is crafted to infiltrate users\u2019 computers through compromised software installers. Once inside, it replaces legitimate Bitcoin and Exodus crypto wallets with infected versions. The mode of infection involves compromised disk images containing an \"activator\" and the desired application. The malware lies dormant until the user runs the activator, which requires entering the user's password. This sneaky tactic ensures that users unwittingly activate the compromised application. The malware then executes a Python script, which runs continuously, attempting to download further stages of infection. This script has dual functions: executing arbitrary commands from a server and checking for the presence of cryptocurrency wallet applications, which it then replaces with malicious versions. The ingenuity of this malware lies in its simplicity and effectiveness. By manipulating executable files of legitimate applications to make them non-functional until the activator is run, hackers ensure that users are tricked into installing the malware. Once activated, the malware can execute any script with administrator privileges, including replacing Exodus and Bitcoin crypto wallet applications with versions that steal secret recovery phrases. To protect against this evolving threat, Kaspersky researchers emphasize the importance of downloading apps only from official stores like the Apple App Store. They also recommend installing a trusted security solution, updating the operating system and apps regularly, and using strong, unique passwords for different accounts. Additionally, it is crucial to secure your seed phrase when setting up hardware wallets. This malware campaign is a stark reminder of the risks associated with downloading pirated applications. It highlights the continuous innovation by hackers in developing tactics to compromise cryptocurrency users. Users are advised to exercise caution and implement robust security measures to protect their digital assets. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "articleSummary": "Congresswoman Maxine Waters scrutinizes Meta's trademark applications, filed in March 2022, suggesting the company's continued involvement in the digital assets ecosystem, despite previous assurances of no ongoing projects in this area.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the Ranking Member of the United States House Financial Services Committee, questions Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook) regarding its trademark applications indicative of a potential expansion in the digital assets ecosystem. Waters' concerns, conveyed in a letter dated January 22, 2024, to Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Javier Olivan, stem from five trademark applications filed by Meta on March 18, 2022. Despite Meta's assertion on October 12, 2023, that the company was not engaging in any digital assets work, these applications suggest otherwise. The committee is pressing Meta for clarity on any ongoing or planned blockchain or crypto-related projects. The trademark applications cover a range of services in the crypto and blockchain sphere, including trading, exchange, payments, transfers, and the associated hardware and software infrastructure. A Notice of Allowance (NOA) for each filing indicates Meta's applications meet registration requirements. Meta must now file a statement of use or request an extension within six months of the NOA issuance dates, which range from August 2023 to January 2024. This inquiry isn't Maxine Waters' first involvement in scrutinizing tech giants' forays into the digital assets sector. In 2019, Waters was vocal in her concerns over Meta\u2019s Libra (later Diem) stablecoin project. Meta had announced its plans to develop the cryptocurrency and a corresponding digital wallet, Calibra. However, the project faced significant backlash from lawmakers and regulators, leading to its eventual discontinuation and the sale of its assets to Silvergate Bank in January 2022. Waters' letter questions the extent of Meta's involvement in digital assets, including any plans to launch a crypto payments platform, the company's research into stablecoins, partnerships with stablecoin projects, and the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT). The congresswoman is particularly concerned about the implications of big tech companies like Meta entering the digital assets space, given their access to vast amounts of user data and the lack of a federal framework for regulating such ventures. In the broader context, Meta's involvement in digital assets reflects a growing trend among tech giants exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency as potential new business avenues. However, this expansion raises critical questions about user privacy, data security, regulatory compliance, and the impact on traditional financial systems. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "To combat terrorism financing, the U.S., UK, and Australia have imposed a fifth round of sanctions on Hamas, specifically targeting its virtual currency transfer networks. This action, announced on January 22, 2024, marks a concerted effort by these nations to disrupt the financial mechanisms that support terrorist activities, particularly those facilitated by cryptocurrency. The U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) spearheaded this initiative, focusing on networks affiliated with Hamas in Gaza, including their owners and associates. These networks have been instrumental in channeling funds, including those from cryptocurrency transfers, from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in Gaza. This round of sanctions is part of a broader strategy that includes previous joint actions with the UK targeting Hamas leaders and financiers, as well as U.S. actions targeting sources of Hamas support and financing. The sanctions specifically target the Shamlakh Network, with key individuals such as Gaza-based financial facilitator Zuhair Shamlakh playing a prominent role. Shamlakh has been involved in transferring substantial funds from Iran to Hamas, utilizing his companies for these transactions. These financial activities have been ongoing since at least 2017, with millions of dollars being transferred to support terrorist groups in Gaza. The UK's sanctions are aligned with those of the U.S., targeting key figures in Hamas and PIJ's financial networks. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron emphasized the message that there is no hiding place for those financing terrorist activities. The sanctions include asset freezes and travel bans, aimed at disrupting the flow of funding from Iran to these terrorist groups. The UK is dedicated to working with international partners to tackle Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the Middle East, including its support for militant groups. In addition to the U.S. and UK, Australia has also joined in imposing sanctions on key Hamas officials and facilitators. This coordinated international effort reflects a unified stance against the financing of terrorism and the exploitation of cryptocurrency for such purposes. These sanctions are significant as they highlight the increasing use of digital currencies by terrorist groups to fund their operations. The underground financial networks created by these groups exploit legitimate businesses to conceal the flow of terrorist funding. By targeting these networks, the U.S., UK, and Australia aim to undermine the financial infrastructure that supports Hamas\u2019s terrorist activities. The latest sanctions follow earlier ones imposed after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. This coordinated effort by the U.S., UK, and Australia demonstrates their commitment to disrupting the financial networks of terrorist groups and preventing them from accessing funding through modern financial mechanisms, including cryptocurrencies.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Nocturne, a crypto project backed by prominent figures like Vitalik Buterin, recently announced the shutdown of its first version, Nocturne v1. The project initially focused on enhancing account abstraction (AA) and crypto accessibility, emphasizing privacy at the account layer as a unique and challenging goal in the crypto world. Founded in the United States, Nocturne aimed to enable users to transact anonymously within the Ethereum ecosystem. The project stood out by combining stealth addresses, zero-knowledge proofs, and account abstraction, offering a novel solution to enable private accounts on public blockchains. Despite its initial goals, Nocturne is shifting its focus towards developing a new product in the application space. This decision comes after recognizing the need to address immediate user concerns about cost and user experience (UX) before delving into privacy aspects. The team realized that the transition to public Layer 2 solutions (L2s) and broader AA adoption must precede efforts in privacy enhancement. Nocturne achieved milestones, such as exceeding $500k in Total Value Locked (TVL) and $2M in volume within a month. However, recognizing the changing landscape and user priorities in the crypto sector, the project is now poised to tackle tech and user-facing problems that are of immediate concern today. For current Nocturne v1 users, the platform has paused deposits, swaps, and staking, providing a one-year window for fund withdrawals via their website. As Nocturne transitions towards its new vision, the crypto community awaits further details on the upcoming product. This strategic pivot reflects the dynamic nature of the crypto industry, where projects must continuously adapt to user needs and market trends. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) marked a considerable 85% decrease in financial losses due to security incidents in 2023, compared to $1.1 billion in the previous year. The total losses reported were over $161 million, indicating a major improvement in blockchain security. This noteworthy reduction in losses is attributed to several strategic security measures implemented by the BNB Chain Core Development Team, including the proactive alert system of AvengerDAO, which played a crucial role in preempting scams and hacks. In 2023, AvengerDAO issued numerous alerts, such as around 3,500 Red Alarm notifications and 330 alert tweets, significantly reducing the impact of potential security threats. Despite the decline in financial loss, BSC experienced a 44% increase in security incidents year-on-year, with a total of 414 incidents reported in 2023, out of which 315 occurred in DeFi projects. However, the final quarter of 2023 saw a 64% decrease in fiat losses compared to the third quarter. This decline is further backed by a 51% reduction in hack incidents in Q4, dropping from 130 in Q3 to 86 in Q4. The report categorizes the types of attacks and threats on BSC, with hacks constituting 50.72% of the incidents, closely followed by scams at 49.03%. Scams accounted for $87.9 million in losses, a 54% decrease, whereas hacks led to $73.2 million in losses, marking a 91% decrease. The AvengerDAO's meter API played a significant role in this achievement by scanning over 1 million unique contract addresses and identifying 35,000 as high risk. Despite some missed opportunities for safeguarding projects, the initiative has been effective in mitigating threats on BSC. Comparing hack values between the two most recent six-month periods, there's been a substantial decline in losses: from over $713 million in the latter half of 2022 to about $34 million in the first half of 2023. This positive trend in BSC's security landscape is also reflected in its vulnerability statistics. BNB Chain accounted for only 0.9% of the total vulnerabilities in the ecosystem based on TVL in Q1 2023. Furthermore, only around 9% of the estimated 2,000 active projects in the ecosystem were impacted in H1 2023. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Hong Kong's financial sector is witnessing a transformative phase with Venture Smart Financial Holdings Ltd. (VSFG) at the forefront, aiming to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the first quarter of 2024. This move comes as part of Hong Kong's broader ambition to establish itself as a digital asset hub. Venture Smart Financial Holdings' strategic decision aligns with Hong Kong\u2019s evolving regulatory landscape, which has recently become more conducive to cryptocurrency innovations. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong has signaled a progressive shift in the region\u2019s approach to digital assets, opening doors for spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The focus of VSFG is not merely the introduction of a new financial product but also achieving significant growth in its assets under management. The firm has set an ambitious target of reaching $500 million in assets under management by the end of 2024. Brian Chan, VSFG\u2019s group head of investment and product, emphasizes the vast potential of the market, underlining the company\u2019s commitment to becoming a key player in the cryptocurrency domain. This initiative follows Hong Kong\u2019s introduction of a dedicated virtual-asset regulatory framework in June 2023, which allows retail investors to trade major tokens like Bitcoin and Ether on licensed exchanges. The regulatory framework aims to balance the city's innovative edge with investor protection. Currently, Hong Kong permits futures-based crypto ETFs, with three such funds listed: CSOP Bitcoin Futures, CSOP Ether Futures, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures. At least 10 fund managers in Hong Kong are reportedly preparing to launch crypto-based ETFs, making the landscape highly competitive and innovative. The recent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which garnered over $13 billion in cumulative trading volume, has influenced the Asian market, with Hong Kong likely to accelerate Bitcoin ETF applications in the coming months. This move by VSFG is indicative of a broader trend in Hong Kong, where the financial sector is increasingly embracing cryptocurrency. As the market for cryptocurrency continues to mature, the introduction of more regulated products like spot Bitcoin ETFs is expected to attract a broader range of investors, potentially leading to more stabilized and mainstream adoption of digital currencies. The development of a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is a testament to the evolving financial landscape, where traditional investment firms are increasingly integrating digital assets into their portfolios. Hong Kong\u2019s dedicated virtual-asset regulatory framework, combined with initiatives like VSFG's spot Bitcoin ETF, positions the city to reclaim its status as Asia\u2019s leading crypto hub.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Virginia State Senate has introduced a significant piece of legislation, Senate Bill No. 339, aimed at regulating digital asset mining and transactions. Proposed by Senator Saddam Azlan Salim on January 10, 2024, this bill seeks to amend existing sections and add new ones to the Code of Virginia, specifically addressing areas like digital asset mining, the use and transfer of digital assets, securities exemption, and tax exemption. A key aspect of the bill is its provision regarding digital asset mining. According to the bill, no person shall be required to obtain a license for engaging in digital asset mining or related business activities as defined in Section 15.2-2288.9 of the Code. This section clarifies the legality of home digital asset mining, provided it complies with local noise ordinances. It also states that local industrial zones cannot prohibit digital asset mining activities, provided these comply with applicable general industrial noise ordinances. In terms of tax treatment, the bill proposes a significant change. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, individuals can subtract up to $200 per transaction of any net capital gain from exchanges made using digital assets to purchase goods or services. This amount is subject to annual adjustment based on changes in the United States Average Consumer Price Index. The introduction of Senate Bill No. 339 represents a forward-thinking approach to the regulation of digital assets. By exempting individuals and businesses from money transmitter licenses and safeguarding miners from discrimination in industrial zones, the bill acknowledges the growing relevance of digital assets in today\u2019s economy. Moreover, the tax treatment adjustments reflect an attempt to adapt traditional financial regulations to the evolving landscape of digital transactions. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The world of digital collectibles is witnessing an important development with the introduction of former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s latest NFT collection, minted as Bitcoin Ordinals. This move marks a significant shift in the NFT space, leveraging the robustness and longevity of the Bitcoin blockchain. Trump's Foray into Bitcoin Ordinals Donald Trump has consistently expanded his presence in the digital collectible market, releasing several NFT collections since late 2022. These collections were initially operated on the Polygon blockchain. However, in a bold crossover, Trump's latest Mugshot Edition Collection has now been integrated into the Bitcoin blockchain, offering a \"one-of-one Bitcoin Ordinal digital trading card\" as a rare digital collectible. This integration into Bitcoin provides unique advantages over other platforms, particularly in terms of scarcity and longevity. Ordinals inscribe data like images and text directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, embedding collectible content at the protocol level, unlike other NFTs, which typically contain a link to a digital art file hosted on a conventional web server. This ensures the immutability and accessibility of the data. The Mugshot Edition Collection The Mugshot Edition Collection, limited to only 200 Bitcoin Ordinal cards, features a unique promotion. Out of these, 101 will be allocated as part of the promotional offer, while the remaining 99 are available for purchase. To qualify for a Mugshot Edition Bitcoin Ordinals card, collectors must purchase 100 Mugshot Edition NFTs using wrapped ETH, at a total cost of $9,900. This collection showcases Trump\u2019s life and career, with the mugshot NFTs, priced at $99 each, reflecting personal moments. Buyers purchasing 47 or more cards will have opportunities such as attending a dinner with Trump and receiving a piece of the suit worn during his arrest, with some NFTs potentially bearing Trump\u2019s signature. Economic Implications and Collector Interest Despite their high price, these digital trading cards have attracted significant interest. Revenue from the new collection, channeled through a licensing deal with Trump-owned CIC Digital, contributes to Trump's finances. The original collection's trading volume peaked at over 200,000 ETH in February 2023. However, these new Mugshot Edition NFTs are non-transferable until the end of 2024, emphasizing their nature as collectibles rather than investment vehicles. Conclusion Donald Trump's venture into Bitcoin Ordinals with his digital trading cards represents a novel intersection of celebrity, politics, and blockchain technology. This move not only taps into the collector psychology but also opens new pathways for digital collectibles in popular culture. As virtual assets continue to find unique applications, the integration of diverse blockchain technologies like Bitcoin Ordinals heralds an era of creative and enduring digital collectibles.

        "articleSummary": "BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, halts its plans for a spot XRP ETF due to ongoing regulatory uncertainties and concerns over XRP's legal status in the midst of the Ripple vs. SEC case.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-22",
        "detailedArticleContent": "BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has recently announced its decision to shelve plans for launching a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). This decision comes amid ongoing regulatory uncertainties and concerns over XRP's legal status, marking a significant shift in BlackRock\u2019s digital currency strategy. The move is particularly noteworthy given BlackRock's previously demonstrated interest in the cryptocurrency space. CEO Larry Fink had hinted at the firm's engagement with XRP, but a July ruling that brought confusion over XRP's legal standing has played a pivotal role in BlackRock's decision to step back from this initiative. The lack of clarity, along with the possibility of the verdict being subject to appeal, positions XRP as a precarious option for traditional financial entities considering the introduction of cryptocurrency-based ETFs. The broader cryptocurrency market, including XRP, has experienced a downturn in value, reflecting a bearish sentiment among investors. XRP's price has dropped to around $0.50, a decline attributed to market participants bracing for potential appeals by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could further complicate the regulatory landscape for digital assets like XRP. The speculation over the launch of an XRP ETF had been rife in the cryptocurrency community, fueled by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s elusive comments during a Fox Business interview. However, the regulatory ambiguity surrounding XRP, largely due to the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle, has made it a risky venture for established financial institutions. Despite this setback, the cryptocurrency has recently reached a new milestone with over 5 million wallets on its network and a notable surge in transaction volumes, indicating growing adoption. BlackRock's decision not to pursue an XRP ETF at this juncture reflects the cautious approach of major financial players in navigating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulations. It underscores the need for clearer regulatory frameworks to foster the integration of digital assets into traditional financial products like ETFs. As the Ripple vs. SEC case unfolds, its outcomes could shape the future of cryptocurrency-based financial products and the broader acceptance of digital assets within the established financial sector.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-21",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has made significant headlines in the cryptocurrency world with his recent actions on the Binance exchange. Since December 18, 2023, Sun has reportedly withdrawn a total of $60 million in various cryptocurrencies from Binance, a move that has captured the attention of the crypto community and sparked considerable speculation regarding its impact on the market. The withdrawn assets encompass a diverse array of cryptocurrencies, including 17,433 units of Ethereum (ETH) valued at approximately $43 million, 68,999 AAVE tokens worth around $6.7 million, and a staggering 656.4 billion SHIB (Shiba Inu) tokens equivalent to $6.3 million. Additionally, the withdrawals included 61,249 LINK (Chainlink) tokens ($957,000), 27.16 billion FLOKI (Floki Inu) tokens ($885,000), 1.7 million MANA (Decentraland) tokens ($826,000), and 100,100 BAND (Band Protocol) tokens ($168,000). This series of transactions, particularly the withdrawal of half a trillion SHIB tokens from Binance, has not only intrigued the crypto community but also raised questions about Sun's intentions and strategies. His interest in the Shiba Inu token, in particular, has been noteworthy. In December 2023, he withdrew 500 billion SHIB, worth approximately $5.22 million, followed by an additional 79.33 billion SHIB tokens later, valued at around $789,000. Sun's moves come at a time when the crypto market is highly sensitive to major transactions by influential figures. Large-scale withdrawals from exchanges can affect the circulating supply of cryptocurrencies, potentially influencing their scarcity and value. Moreover, the timing and choice of the assets involved in these transactions are critical for market dynamics, given the fluctuating nature of cryptocurrency values. In light of these developments, the cryptocurrency market is closely monitoring Sun's actions for any further significant transactions. His investment strategies and portfolio adjustments are often seen as indicators of broader market trends, especially in the context of meme coins and major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and AAVE.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-21",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The year 2023 marked a notable recovery and transformation in the cryptocurrency industry, characterized by resilience and significant developments across various sectors, according to CoinGecko. Total Market Capitalization and Trading Volume The total cryptocurrency market capitalization witnessed a remarkable surge, growing by 108.1% to reach $1.72 trillion. This growth was driven by various factors, including growing confidence in the cryptocurrency market and anticipation of regulatory developments such as the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The industry also recorded a substantial trading volume, totaling $36.6 trillion throughout the year. The fourth quarter alone saw a 53.1% increase in trading volume, reaching $10.3 trillion, marking the first quarter-on-quarter growth of the year. This upswing was fueled by bullish market sentiment and anticipation of Bitcoin spot ETF approvals in the United States. NFT Market Dynamics The non-fungible token (NFT) market, while experiencing a decrease in total trading volume compared to 2022, still registered a significant $11.8 billion in 2023. Ethereum continued to dominate this space, although its market share declined from 90% in 2022 to 72.3% in 2023. Notably, Bitcoin's introduction of Ordinals and the rising popularity of other chains like Solana marked critical developments in the sector. Stablecoin Landscape Stablecoins remained a critical component of the crypto ecosystem, with their total market capitalization at $121.3 billion in Q3 2023, despite a 3.8% decline. Tether (USDT) maintained a stable market cap and increased its market share, while USD Coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD) saw declines. New entrants in the stablecoin market included PayPal\u2019s First Digital USD (FDUSD) and others, highlighting the ongoing evolution and expansion of this sector. Centralized Exchanges Maintain Dominance Despite the FTX collapse in 2022 and regulatory challenges faced by Binance in 2023, centralized exchanges (CEXs) continued to dominate the crypto trading landscape. The spot trading volume ratio between CEXs and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) stood at 91.4%, indicating a strong preference for centralized platforms. Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin showed a remarkable performance in 2023, with its value increasing 2.6-fold, rising from $27,000 to $42,000 in the last quarter. Other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) also made significant leaps in the market cap rankings, while new entrants such as Internet Computer (ICP) and Near Protocol (NEAR) emerged in the top 30. Conclusion The year 2023 proved to be a year of recovery and evolution for the cryptocurrency industry. Despite previous setbacks, the market demonstrated resilience and adaptability, with significant growth in total market cap and trading volumes, evolving dynamics in the NFT and stablecoin sectors, and the continued dominance of centralized exchanges. These trends underscore the cryptocurrency industry's ongoing maturation and its increasing integration into the broader financial landscape. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Horst Jicha, the German founder of USI Tech, a crypto mining and digital-asset trading platform, faces severe legal consequences in the United States. Federal prosecutors in New York charged Jicha with orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that allegedly defrauded investors of approximately $150 million, according to DOJ official website. This case highlights the ongoing risks and regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency sector. Jicha, 64, has been accused of multiple crimes, including securities fraud, money laundering, and wire fraud. He was arrested on December 23, 2023, while attempting to vacation in Miami. This arrest marks a significant development in a saga that has been unfolding for several years. In 2017, Jicha claimed USI Tech was the world's first automated Bitcoin trading platform, aiming to make crypto investments more accessible to retail investors. He aggressively marketed the platform in the United States, particularly in New York and Las Vegas. However, by March 2018, as authorities began their investigation, Jicha abruptly shut down the USI online platform. This action blocked withdrawals of about $150 million worth of investor-owned crypto assets, which remain unaccounted for. The FBI's involvement underscores the seriousness of the allegations. James Smith, head of the FBI's New York office, stated that the platform was merely a facade and accused Jicha of fleeing the country with millions of investors' money. Jicha's case, filed as US v Jicha, 23-CR-342 in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn), represents a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with unregulated investment platforms, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The case also underlines the increasing efforts by U.S. authorities to clamp down on fraudulent activities in the crypto space. Jicha has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on a $5 million bond. His defense lawyers, Marissel Descalzo and David Tarras, have expressed their intention to defend Jicha vigorously, seeking to bring to light the facts of his involvement with USI Tech. They aim to distinguish Jicha's actions from those of the actual \"bad actors.\" This development in the crypto world is a critical reminder for investors to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in digital assets. It also highlights the need for improved regulatory frameworks to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the crypto market. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Peter Kambolin, the former CEO of Systematic Alpha Management LLC (SAM), has been sentenced, for his involvement in a fraudulent \"cherry-picking\" scheme involving cryptocurrency futures contracts. In April 2023, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged Kambolin and SAM with executing a scheme that involved allocating profitable futures trades in crypto to their in-house accounts, while assigning losses or less lucrative trades to their clients. This case highlights the increasing scrutiny by regulatory bodies on the practices within the cryptocurrency trading world. Kambolin, a 48-year-old U.S.-Russian national, pleaded guilty on October 11, 2023, to conspiracy to commit commodities fraud. He was found to have fraudulently allocated profitable futures trades to his personal accounts, while his investors suffered the losses. This malpractice occurred between January 2019 and November 2021, a period during which Kambolin promoted his firm as a platform specializing in algorithmic trading strategies in futures contracts. The misrepresentation to investors was a critical aspect of this case. Kambolin led his clients to believe that SAM was primarily focused on trading cryptocurrency and foreign exchange futures contracts. However, nearly half of his trading activities were in equity index futures, a fact he concealed from his investors. This deception not only deprived investors of profitable trades but also undermined their confidence in the commodities market. The legal consequences for Kambolin's actions were severe. He was sentenced to two years in prison, followed by 18 months of home confinement, and was ordered to forfeit approximately $1.6 million. This case underscores the U.S. Department of Justice's commitment to prosecuting financial market malpractices, particularly those involving emerging technologies like cryptocurrencies. This case is a stark reminder of the risks associated with the nascent and often volatile cryptocurrency market. It illustrates the importance of regulatory oversight to protect investors from fraudulent schemes and to maintain the integrity of the financial markets. The cherry-picking scheme perpetrated by Kambolin serves as a cautionary tale for both investors and operators within the cryptocurrency space. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed charges against the cryptocurrency exchange Debiex, alleging a romance scam that led to a misappropriation of $2.3 million. The CFTC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, accuses Debiex and an individual, Zhāng Chéng Yáng, of engaging in fraudulent activities known as \"pig butchering\" to deceive investors. According to the CFTC, from March 2022 onwards, Debiex's officers and\/or managers allegedly fostered friendly or romantic relationships with potential customers. They reportedly communicated falsehoods to gain the trust of these individuals, then encouraged them to open and fund trading accounts with Debiex. The scheme was designed to assure customers that their funds would be invested in cryptocurrencies. However, the CFTC alleges that these funds were misappropriated for personal gain. Despite only identifying five victims over a two-year period, the regulatory body claims that over $2 million was stolen through this scheme. This case highlights the growing trend of romance scams in the cryptocurrency sector, where scammers leverage the lure of digital assets to exploit victims financially. Such scams have been on the rise, with a significant increase in reported losses due to cryptocurrency-related frauds in the United States. In 2022 alone, over 46,000 people reported losing money in crypto-related frauds, a staggering 183% increase from $907 million in 2021 to $2.57 billion in 2022. This incident is not an isolated case in the world of cryptocurrency exchanges. In May 2023, Binance faced allegations from a Texas woman who claimed she was swindled out of $8 million by a man she met on Tinder. The woman argued that Binance should be held responsible as it provided exchange services to the scammer, although a U.S. judge later ruled that there was no evidence of Binance's involvement in the theft. The Debiex case serves as a cautionary tale for individuals engaging with cryptocurrency platforms, especially as Valentine's Day approaches, a time when romance scams typically intensify. The CFTC's action against Debiex underscores the need for vigilance in the digital asset space, where the convergence of online dating and investment can create ripe opportunities for fraud.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Marco Ochoa, the former CEO of the crypto mining firm IcomTech, has been sentenced to five years in prison for his involvement in a Ponzi scheme using cryptocurrencies. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, under Judge Jennifer Rochon, ordered Ochoa to forfeit $914,000 and voluntarily surrender for a 60-month sentence starting March 19, with two years of supervised release following his imprisonment. Ochoa's tenure at IcomTech, which spanned from 2018 to 2019, was marked by deceitful practices that significantly harmed investors. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the scheme. The case reflects a broader crackdown by U.S. authorities on fraudulent activities within the cryptocurrency sector. The Ponzi scheme orchestrated by IcomTech promised investors daily returns on investment products. However, it was discovered that these returns were unattainable, and investors were unable to withdraw their funds. This scheme caused significant financial damage to numerous individuals who had placed their trust and investments in the company. Ochoa's sentencing is the most severe among the former executives of IcomTech involved in the case. This decision is part of a growing trend of U.S. regulatory and judicial scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, particularly focusing on fraudulent activities and scams. Other notable figures in the crypto industry have also faced legal challenges, including the former CEOs of FTX and Binance, who have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to various charges. This case underscores the vital importance of regulatory oversight in the cryptocurrency industry and serves as a cautionary tale for investors about the risks associated with emerging financial technologies and markets.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "South Korea's Presidential Office has taken a proactive stance regarding the trading of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This development emerges just a week after the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the nation's principal financial regulator, warned against the trading of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Office of the President of the Republic of Korea, also known as the Yongsan Presidential Office, has urged the FSC to reconsider its position. Sung Tae-yoon, the head of the presidential policy office, stated, \u201CWe are trying to make appropriate changes to the legal system of our country or to consider whether what happens abroad can be accepted in our country.\u201D This statement reflects a willingness to adapt the nation's legal framework in response to international financial developments, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrencies. The FSC's initial warning on January 12, suggesting that trading or brokering overseas-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs might violate the Capital Markets Act, led to major securities firms in South Korea suspending trading of these ETFs. However, the recent statement from the Presidential Office indicates a potential shift in policy direction. The FSC acknowledged that cryptocurrency regulation is an evolving field and that its policies should be reviewed continuously as global markets develop. This reconsideration by the Presidential Office also aligns with broader trends in the region. While South Korea is reassessing its approach to Bitcoin ETFs, other Asian countries like Singapore and Thailand have expressed reluctance to adopt them. In contrast, Hong Kong is emerging as a potential hub for these financial instruments, with several fund managers showing interest in launching spot crypto ETFs in the city. This development in South Korea's stance towards Bitcoin ETFs highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of cryptocurrency regulation globally. The government's consideration of foreign affairs in local regulations indicates its willingness to adapt to changing financial landscapes, potentially embracing digital assets as a legitimate investment option. However, the varied approaches within Asia show that each country is navigating the cryptocurrency landscape differently, considering unique regulatory environments and market conditions. In addition to the Bitcoin ETF discussions, South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is reportedly planning to introduce new regulations around digital asset mixing services. These services help maintain privacy and reduce traceability of funds across multiple chains, but they also raise concerns about money laundering. The FIU's move follows U.S. sanctions against crypto mixers and aims to counter illegal money laundering operations. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Lee Jung-Hoon, the former chairman of Bithumb Holdings and Bithumb Korea, has been acquitted of fraud charges for the second time. The Seoul High Court\u2019s 5th Criminal Division recently issued a not-guilty verdict in a case involving allegations of a $100 million fraud. The case dates back to July 2021, when Lee was indicted on charges of defrauding cosmetic surgeon Kim Byung-Gun of 100 billion won (approximately $82 million) during negotiations for an acquisition deal. This indictment followed accusations that Lee embezzled an acquisition deposit under the guise of listing the \u201CBXA token\u201D on Bithumb\u2019s crypto exchange. However, despite the serious nature of the allegations, the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. This recent ruling aligns with an earlier acquittal in January 2023, where the court found the charges against Lee unproven. The defense highlighted inconsistencies in Kim's testimonies and argued that Lee had fulfilled all his obligations as a seller. The court agreed, ruling that the evidence presented by the prosecution did not conclusively prove that Lee had promised to list the BXA token, which was at the center of the case. Lee's case has been a focal point in the South Korean cryptocurrency sphere, reflecting the complex interplay between emerging digital financial technologies and existing legal frameworks. His acquittal underscores the challenges prosecutors face in proving fraud in high-stakes, high-tech financial cases. The BXA token, which was linked to the Blockchain Exchange Alliance formed by Kim\u2019s consortium in December 2018, was intended to be the financial centerpiece of the acquisition deal. Despite Lee's assurances, the token was never listed on Bithumb. This led prosecutors to assert that Lee's promise was a tactic to deceive Kim and mislead investors. However, the court's decision indicates that these allegations could not be substantiated. Lee's acquittal has broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry, especially regarding the legal complexities surrounding crypto exchanges and token listings. It also highlights the need for clearer regulatory guidelines and legal standards in the rapidly evolving world of digital currencies and blockchain technology. In conclusion, the not-guilty verdict for Lee Jung-Hoon in the $100 million fraud case involving Bithumb and the BXA token signifies a critical moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency and legal proceedings. It sheds light on the challenges of navigating and regulating the intricate and often murky waters of the crypto industry. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The cryptocurrency industry has reached a significant milestone with the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), marking a new era in crypto investment. This development, anticipated for over a decade, signifies a major step in legitimizing cryptocurrency investments and bridging the gap between traditional financial systems and the burgeoning digital asset market. A New Investment Avenue Spot Bitcoin ETFs, unlike their futures-based counterparts, hold actual Bitcoin, offering investors a more direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. This differs from futures-based ETFs, which are based on contracts speculating on future Bitcoin prices. The SEC's approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETF applications, including those from major players like BlackRock, ARK 21Shares, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, and Valkyrie, opens up new avenues for traditional investors to add Bitcoin to their portfolios through regulated financial markets. Market Impact and Investor Sentiment The market anticipates significant capital inflows into these ETFs. Steven McClurg, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments, expects Valkyrie's ETF to attract $200 million to $400 million, with the total market seeing $4 to $5 billion in inflows within the first few weeks. Other major players, like VanEck and Galaxy, have projected inflows of $1 billion within the first few days and $14 billion within the first year, respectively. Bitwise anticipates the market for spot bitcoin ETFs to reach around $72 billion within five years. McClurg also expects an influx of $10 billion or more into spot bitcoin ETFs by the end of the year, with the possibility of total assets under management (AUM) in spot bitcoin ETFs reaching $20 billion when market movements are considered. This bullish sentiment is further bolstered by his prediction that Bitcoin's price could surge to $150,000 or higher by the end of 2024, driven by a supply shock and macroeconomic factors like potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Risks and Challenges Despite the optimism, it's crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks in cryptocurrency investments. Bitcoin's price volatility poses a significant risk, with the potential for both substantial gains and losses. Additionally, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could impact spot Bitcoin ETFs' performance. Conclusion The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs represents a transformative moment for cryptocurrency investments. With regulatory approval and increased accessibility, these ETFs are poised to attract a new wave of investors, making Bitcoin a more mainstream and legitimate investment opportunity. As the market continues to evolve, the full impact of this development on the crypto landscape remains to be seen. Image source: Shutterstock"

The depegging was linked to activities on Binance Launchpool and raises questions about stablecoin stability and transparency.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On January 18, 2024, TrueUSD (TUSD) blames Binance Launchpool mining activities for the depegging on X. It says, Regular attestations are ongoing as part of our standard operations, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect. We have observed recent community mining activities associated with Binance Launchpool, which have led to short-term arbitrage opportunities. The recent depegging of TrueUSD (TUSD) has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. This event was closely associated with the activities on Binance Launchpool and resulted in TUSD's value dropping below its $1 peg, reaching as low as $0.97. On January 15, 2024, a substantial sell-off of TUSD was observed on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, leading to a notable depegging from the US dollar. Over a 24-hour period, traders sold more than $339.2 million worth of TUSD, compared to $296.8 million in buy orders, resulting in a net outflow of $42.3 million from the exchange. The situation was exacerbated when TrueUSD experienced issues with real-time attestations of its reserves around January 10, raising concerns about the stablecoin possibly being undercollateralized. These technical difficulties, identified in the API, prevented the provision of accurate U.S. dollar values to its collateral assets. Additionally, on Poloniex, a cryptocurrency exchange, TUSD had been trading at about 8% below its peg for several weeks, while maintaining a relatively steady price around $0.99 on Binance. Addressing the depegging, the TrueUSD team linked the incident to activities associated with Binance Launchpool. They observed recent community mining activities that led to short-term arbitrage opportunities. Despite concerns, TrueUSD reassured users about the normality of such market dynamics and liquidity adjustments. They emphasized the smooth operation of their redemption channels and the ongoing functionality of TUSD minting and redemption services. This incident of depegging raises broader questions about the stability and transparency of stablecoins in the crypto market. In June 2023, TrueUSD had temporarily halted its automated attestations due to balance discrepancies. The stablecoin issuer later announced an upgrade in their fiat reserve audit and attestation system in partnership with accounting firm MooreHK. TrueUSD stated that their total assets held in reserve accounts amounted to $1.93 billion. The recent decline in TUSD\u2019s value coincided with the introduction of a rival stablecoin, FDUSD, into Binance's staking program. Market analysts speculate that a significant number of investors sold TUSD for FDUSD to participate in Binance\u2019s rewards programs, potentially contributing to TUSD's de-pegging. TrueUSD's depegging highlights the fragility of stablecoins in volatile market conditions and the need for robust mechanisms to maintain pegs to underlying assets. It also underscores the importance of transparency and trust in the management of stablecoin reserves, which are crucial for maintaining investor confidence and the overall stability of the crypto market.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) have proposed changes to guidelines that will impact how public investment funds in Canada handle crypto assets. This move, which aligns with global trends towards more stringent cryptocurrency regulations, reflects the CSA's increasing attention to the unique risks and characteristics of crypto assets. The CSA, a council of the securities regulators of Canada's provinces and territories, aims to harmonize and improve coordination of the Canadian financial markets. On January 18, 2024, they released a draft outlining proposed changes in the regulatory treatment of crypto assets by public investment funds. This proposal is part of a broader project announced in July to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets in Canada. Proposed Changes The primary focus of the amendments is to limit direct crypto asset dealings to certain types of funds and establish rigorous custodianship standards. The key points are: Restriction on Fund Types: Only alternative and non-redeemable investment funds will be allowed to buy, sell, or hold crypto assets directly. Other mutual funds seeking crypto exposure would have to invest in these funds. Exchange Listing Requirement: The invested crypto assets must be listed on a recognized exchange by Canadian securities regulatory authorities and must be fungible. Custodianship and Security: The assets must be insured and held in cold wallets. Additionally, an annual review of the custodian's internal management by a public accountant is mandated. Public Feedback and Development: The CSA has opened these proposals for a 90-day public comment period, after which a consultation paper will be developed. This paper will consider a broader framework for crypto asset regulation. Implications for the Investment Landscape This move by the CSA could have significant implications for the Canadian investment landscape: Risk Mitigation: These changes aim to mitigate risks associated with crypto assets, such as volatility and security concerns. Market Stability: By restricting direct dealings to certain fund types, the CSA seeks to ensure market stability and protect investors. Product Development: The regulatory clarity provided may encourage the development of new crypto-related investment products within a safer framework. Global Trend: This regulatory shift in Canada is part of a global trend towards more comprehensive regulation of cryptocurrencies, aligning Canadian policies with international standards. Conclusion The CSA's proposed amendments mark a pivotal moment in the regulation of crypto assets in Canada. By focusing on custodianship standards and restricting direct crypto dealings to specific fund types, these changes aim to balance the innovative potential of cryptocurrencies with the need for investor protection and market stability.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-18",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, recently voiced his expectations regarding the future of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly focusing on Ether (ETH) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulatory approach. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Garlinghouse emphasized the inevitability of other cryptocurrencies, like Ether, following Bitcoin's path towards ETF approval in the United States, despite not explicitly predicting a similar path for Ripple's XRP. Garlinghouse's comments come in the wake of the SEC's approval of several Bitcoin ETFs, which he believes sets a precedent for similar cryptocurrency investment products. However, he expressed concern over the SEC's current regulatory strategy under Chair Gary Gensler, describing it as a \"political liability\" and not in the best interest of the U.S. economy's long-term growth. He criticized Gensler's repeated actions and expectations for different outcomes, foreseeing a change in SEC's leadership as beneficial for the American people. The Ripple CEO highlighted the U.S. justice system's pressure on the SEC, noting that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs came only after a U.S. court criticized the SEC's approach as arbitrary and capricious. This legal battle sets a concerning precedent for future ETF approvals, which might require similar judicial interventions. Garlinghouse also discussed the significant role of stablecoins like USDT and USDC, advocating for regulatory clarity around them. He expects other entrants in the stablecoin market, emphasizing their importance in solving real-world needs. Ripple's relationship with U.S. regulators, particularly the SEC, has been complex, marked by legal challenges concerning the classification of XRP as a security or currency. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc., its CEO, and co-founder in December 2020, alleging that XRP was an unregistered security. This ongoing legal battle has been a significant point of contention within the cryptocurrency community. In conclusion, Garlinghouse's statements reflect a broader sentiment in the crypto industry regarding regulatory challenges and the potential for broader acceptance of cryptocurrency ETFs in the U.S. market. His insights offer a critical perspective on the SEC's current stance and its implications for the future growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-18",
        "detailedArticleContent": "ProShares, a leading provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, has announced plans to launch a suite of five new Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs, which include Plus Bitcoin ETF, Ultra Bitcoin ETF, UltraShort Bitcoin ETF, Short Bitcoin ETF, and ShortPlus Bitcoin ETF, are designed to provide investors with leveraged and inverse exposure to Bitcoin, reflecting a growing institutional interest in this asset class. The announcement follows the recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a milestone in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial markets. ProShares' new offerings aim to cater to a diverse range of investment strategies by providing indirect exposure to Bitcoin's price movements through the Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin Index (BGCI). Diverse Exposure to Bitcoin's Price Movements ProShares' move to introduce these innovative ETFs is a response to the burgeoning demand for cryptocurrency investment vehicles. The Plus Bitcoin ETF and Ultra Bitcoin ETF seek daily investment results corresponding to a 1.5x and 2x increase from the daily performance of BGCI, respectively. Conversely, the UltraShort Bitcoin ETF, Short Bitcoin ETF, and ShortPlus Bitcoin ETF are designed to offer inverse exposure, with daily investment results based on -2x, -1x, and -1.5x the daily performance of the BGCI. This approach allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly investing in the cryptocurrency itself. Instead, these ETFs may employ financial derivatives or other investment strategies to achieve their investment objectives. The Growing Appeal of Bitcoin ETFs The introduction of these ETFs is timely, given the significant interest and trading volumes observed in recently approved Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have reportedly traded almost $10 billion in just over three days, a substantial volume compared to the combined volume of 500 ETFs launched in 2023. This surge in interest underscores the market's desire for diversified and structured investment options within the digital currency space. Regulatory Developments and Market Evolution In addition to ProShares' filing, major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have taken steps to further integrate cryptocurrencies into the financial system. The NYSE has filed a 19b-4 form, seeking approval for options trading based on Commodity-Based Trust Shares, specifically for spot bitcoin ETFs. Moreover, Grayscale Investments is entering the Bitcoin ETF arena with a covered call ETF, aiming to generate income from its converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). This diversification in Bitcoin-related investment products indicates a maturing market and evolving investor preferences. Conclusion ProShares' introduction of five new leveraged and inverse Bitcoin ETFs is a significant development in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. These ETFs offer investors diverse options to gain exposure to Bitcoin, catering to various investment strategies. As the market continues to mature and regulatory frameworks evolve, the growth and innovation in Bitcoin ETFs are expected to continue, reflecting the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-18",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a legal battle that could set precedents in the cryptocurrency world, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, the parents of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, have asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to dismiss the lawsuit filed against them by the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The lawsuit, filed in September 2023, accuses Bankman and Fried of enriching themselves at the expense of FTX's debtors. FTX alleges that the couple exploited their access and influence within the FTX empire, but Bankman and Fried deny these claims, arguing that their relationship with their son is not legally actionable. Claims and Counterclaims FTX's lawsuit lacked specifics on the total sum allegedly misused by Bankman and Fried but mentioned details like Bankman's salary, property purchases, and donations to Stanford University. Stanford has committed to returning the donations it received from the FTX Group. Bankman and Fried's legal team from Montgomery McCracken Walker & Rhoads challenges the lawsuit's claims, insisting on detailed accusations and a higher burden of proof. They argue that there was no fiduciary tie between them and FTX and no official positions held, questioning the legal grounds of a parent-child relationship resulting in liability. Defense Strategy and Implications The defense strategy focuses on the lack of evidence to hold Bankman and Fried accountable for the alleged misconduct. They demand that FTX provide concrete facts proving the parents' \"actual knowledge\" of wrongful acts and call for a higher burden of proof to be met by FTX in their legal pursuit. This unfolding legal saga is not just a family affair; it's a battle that could set precedents in the crypto world, affecting how crypto exchanges and their affiliates are held accountable in the future.

This follows the crypto community's concerns over the practical challenges of complying with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's rules.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-17",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has recently announced a significant change concerning the reporting of cryptocurrency transactions by US businesses. Initially, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in November 2021, businesses were required to report any cryptocurrency transaction over $10,000 to the IRS, much like cash transactions. However, this requirement has been temporarily put on hold until a comprehensive regulatory framework is established. This development, announced on January 16, 2024, indicates a step back from the IRS in enforcing the new rules, which had come into effect on January 1, 2024. The decision was influenced by a revision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS. The law, as it stood, mandated businesses to report receiving cash or digital assets worth more than $10,000 within 15 days of the transaction. However, the IRS clarified that digital assets do not need to be included in this requirement for now. The initial rules had received significant criticism from the cryptocurrency community. Many users and stakeholders in the crypto industry found the rules challenging to comply with, especially given the lack of clear guidance from the IRS. Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group, had previously filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department, challenging the constitutionality of the law. The legal proceedings are still ongoing, but the law remains enforceable. The IRS and the Treasury intend to issue proposed regulations concerning digital asset reporting. This will also involve a public commenting period, allowing stakeholders to voice their opinions and concerns. Digital asset advocates like the Blockchain Association have welcomed this decision, seeing it as a positive step forward given the complexities associated with reporting cryptocurrency transactions. Despite the temporary relief, the requirement to report large cryptocurrency transactions remains a legal obligation. The IRS has not provided specific guidance on certain practical aspects, like how to report transactions from decentralized exchanges or block rewards exceeding $10,000. The law's criteria for evaluating the $10,000 threshold in terms of cryptocurrency value are also unclear. The IRS's pause in enforcing this requirement provides a window for the cryptocurrency community and regulators to work towards more practical and clear guidelines. This situation exemplifies the ongoing challenges in regulating the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. As governments and regulatory bodies attempt to integrate digital assets into the existing financial and legal frameworks, they face the complex task of balancing regulatory requirements with the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies. This delay by the IRS might be seen as an acknowledgment of these challenges and a willingness to engage with the crypto community to develop more effective regulations. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, is making strategic moves to solidify its position in the DEX market with the upcoming launch of Uniswap v4. The main objective of this deployment is to capture a significant portion of the market involving long tail assets and small capitalization tokens, a domain primarily managed by Uniswap v2. Despite the successful introduction of Uniswap v3, v2 continues to be popular among users, managing an impressive $1.8 billion in TVL. This enduring popularity of v2 can be attributed to its effectiveness in handling a variety of assets. However, with the advancement of Uniswap v4, the platform aims to take this functionality to the next level. Recent data from Dune Analytics reveals that over 90% of new Uniswap pools are still being created on v2, indicating a strong user preference that v4 seeks to capitalize on. The development of v4 is supported by a budget of $300,000, with the project scheduled to commence by February 16. This investment highlights Uniswap's commitment to evolving and improving its offerings, ensuring it remains at the forefront of the DeFi space. The new version is expected to introduce innovative features like on-chain limit orders, automatic deposits to lending protocols, and auto-compounded liquidity provider fees, enhancing the overall user experience. One of the standout features of Uniswap v4 is the introduction of a more sophisticated user interface. This upgrade is targeted at making the platform more accessible and efficient, especially for dealing with small cap tokens and long tail assets. Additionally, Uniswap aims to integrate hooks architecture in v4, allowing users to execute contracts in various states, offering greater flexibility and customization options within liquidity pools. Security is also a focus for Uniswap v4, with attention being paid to the potential risks associated with the new hook mechanism. This mechanism is pivotal for the platform's functionality but brings with it unique challenges that need to be addressed to ensure user safety and platform integrity. In terms of market impact, the anticipation of Uniswap v4 has already created a positive sentiment among investors, with a notable increase in whale accumulation of UNI tokens. This bullish trend is also reflected in the technical analysis of the UNIUSD pair, indicating a strong market momentum in favor of Uniswap. In conclusion, Uniswap's v4 deployment is a strategic move to enhance its market position, focusing on areas that have remained under the radar but hold substantial potential for growth. By improving the user interface and integrating new features, Uniswap v4 is set to redefine the DEX experience, particularly for long tail assets and small cap tokens Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Circle, a leading financial technology firm, recently released its 2024 State of the USDC Economy Report, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of digital currencies. The report, titled 'Welcome to the Era of Open Money,' provides a comprehensive overview of the USDC, a regulated stablecoin's, performance and adoption trends, particularly in the context of the global regulatory environment for payment stablecoins. The report highlights the remarkable growth of USDC in the financial ecosystem. One of the standout statistics is the 59% increase in the number of USDC wallets, with a balance of at least $10, reaching about 2.7 million in the past year. This growth is indicative of the increasing acceptance and usage of stablecoins in the broader financial landscape. Since its introduction in 2018, USDC has been instrumental in settling over $12 trillion in blockchain transactions. In 2023 alone, Circle facilitated more than $197 billion of transfers between the banking system and blockchain networks through minting and redeeming. Furthermore, USDC has been a part of 595 million transactions from January through November 2023. Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a significant technological advancement, has further enhanced the usability of USDC. The CCTP, launched in April 2023, has already facilitated 66,500 transactions. This protocol reduces friction, increases safety and security, and cuts costs when sending USDC across different blockchains. The report also emphasizes USDC's efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Even on Ethereum, known for high gas fees, the average cost per transaction with USDC was less than 1% of the transaction in 2023. On other networks, like Solana, it was even less than a tenth of a percent. Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder and CEO of Circle, reflected on the transformative impact of USDC in enhancing financial inclusion and access. He noted that while the journey is still in its early stages, the 2024 report indicates growing momentum. Allaire highlighted the emerging regulatory clarity for stablecoins and the adoption of this technology by mainstream financial institutions, fintechs, internet firms, and enterprises, positioning USDC to play a central role in the new internet financial system. The report also sheds light on USDC's role in streamlining global finance, disrupting remittances, cross-border payments, aid disbursement, and charitable giving, and providing a stable store of value to counteract high inflation effects. This is backed by case studies with major financial service providers and technology leaders, including Visa, MoneyGram, Grab, Nubank, Stripe, Worldpay from FIS, and others. In the broader context of decentralized finance (DeFi), USDC remains dominant. Despite challenges like the collapse of a key banking partner, USDC has maintained its position as a crucial stablecoin in the DeFi ecosystem. This resilience underlines the stablecoin's robustness and the trust it has garnered in the market. However, it's not all positive news. The report acknowledges the challenges faced by USDC, particularly in terms of market capitalization. Peaking at $56 billion in June 2022, USDC's market cap experienced a significant decline, dropping to just over $24 billion in mid-November 2023, a nearly 60% decrease. Despite this, the stablecoin has seen a rebound in recent months, adding more than $1 billion to its market cap and ranking seventh among all digital assets. The 2024 State of the USDC Economy Report is a testament to the growing significance of stablecoins in the financial world. It underscores Circle's commitment to fostering an inclusive, equitable, and promising future, paving the way towards a more accessible and efficient financial system. Image source: Shutterstock"

The study focuses on the challenges faced by law enforcement against the backdrop of evolving online casinos, cyberfraud, and tech-driven underground banking networks.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-16",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report, titled \"Casinos, Money Laundering, Underground Banking, and Transnational Organized Crime in East and Southeast Asia: A Hidden and Accelerating Threat,\" issued in January 2024, reveals a complex and concerning situation regarding the misuse of cryptocurrencies and technological innovations in illicit economies, particularly in East and Southeast Asia. Key Findings Transformation of Organized Crime: There has been a significant evolution in transnational organized crime in Southeast Asia, particularly with the growth in cross-border trafficking of synthetic drugs and other commodities. Organized crime groups have embraced technology, leading to a revolutionized crime environment in the region. Rise of Online Casinos and Cyberfraud: The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the mushrooming of online casinos and cyberfraud across Southeast Asia, especially in the Mekong region. Organized crime groups running many of these operations have utilized data mining, blockchain technology, and increasingly generative AI, significantly complicating law enforcement efforts. Underground Banking and Money Laundering: The report highlights the integral role of casinos and junkets in the underground banking and money laundering infrastructure. This includes various methods like cash-in cash-out, collusion between gamblers, junket financing, and misuse of casino VIP cash accounts. Infiltration of Cryptocurrency in Illegal Activities: Organized crime groups are increasingly integrating cryptocurrencies into their illegal betting operations. This includes the use of sophisticated high-speed money laundering 'motorcade' teams specializing in underground USDT \u2013 fiat currency exchanges. Challenges in Monitoring and Regulation: The rise of cryptocurrency-integrated operations, points running syndicates, and the complex nature of online gambling platforms pose significant challenges to authorities. The anonymous nature of transactions and the lack of adequate compliance staff in online gambling sectors make it difficult to track and verify the source of funds. Generative AI and Deepfake Fraud: There's a growing concern about the use of advanced technologies like generative AI and deepfake for cyber fraud schemes. These technologies enable scammers to create highly realistic images and voices, leading to sophisticated investment fraud and other malicious activities. Policy and Enforcement Recommendations: The report suggests the development of national action plans and a regional strategy to address these challenges. It emphasizes the need for revised legislation related to money laundering, asset forfeiture, and casino management. Additionally, it recommends the establishment of a regional inter-agency forum to share information and intelligence, improved digital forensic capabilities, and mandatory filing of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) by casinos. Conclusion The report underscores the growing complexity of organized crime in the digital age, highlighting the need for stronger regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to tackle these evolving threats.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-16",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has consented to postpone the trial of Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon, pending Kwon's extradition. This follows a filing by the SEC on January 15, 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The trial, originally scheduled to commence on January 29, is now proposed to start no earlier than March 18, 2024. Kwon, currently in Montenegro following his arrest in March 2023, is facing charges for allegedly orchestrating a $40 billion cryptocurrency fraud. The SEC, fully prepared to proceed with the trial, joined Kwon's legal team in requesting the adjournment to ensure his participation in the trial. The Terraform Labs co-founder's legal team, dealing with the complexities of extradition, suggested that Kwon could be in the United States by mid-March. If the trial is postponed, the SEC has requested that it commence on April 15, 2024. The allegations against Terraform Labs and Kwon stem from the collapse of TerraUSD, a stablecoin designed to maintain a constant $1 price, and Luna, a closely linked token. Both cryptocurrencies suffered a catastrophic loss in May 2022 when TerraUSD failed to maintain its peg, leading to a market loss of $40 billion or more. This event marked a significant downturn in the crypto market that year and had far-reaching implications in the industry. Furthermore, Terraform Labs and Kwon are accused of misleading investors about the stability of TerraUSD and its usage in a popular Korean mobile payment app. In addition to the SEC's civil case, Kwon also faces criminal charges in the U.S. and an extradition request from South Korea. The outcome of this trial could significantly impact the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies, given the scale of the alleged fraud and the involvement of multiple international jurisdictions.

        "detailedArticleContent": "HashKey Group, a digital asset financial services group in Asia, completed a Series A financing round, raising nearly US $100 million, according to press release shared with Blockchain.News by Hashkey. This funding brings the company's pre-money valuation to over US $1.2 billion, elevating HashKey to \"unicorn\" status in the venture capital industry, which is used to describe startups valued over $1 billion. In 2023, HashKey made significant strides in the Hong Kong virtual asset industry. It launched the first licensed virtual asset exchange App in Hong Kong, offering secure and seamless one-stop virtual asset trading services. Within four months of its launch, the HashKey Exchange registered over 155,000 users and reported a daily average trading volume of US$630 million over the past 30 days. The Exchange has also established strategic partnerships with over ten brokerage firms and six public listed companies. HashKey Group's newly raised capital will be used to further develop its Web3 ecosystem, enhance the product diversification of its licensed business in Hong Kong, and support the Group's global expansion. HashKey's core businesses include HashKey Capital, a global asset manager focusing exclusively on blockchain technology and digital assets; HashKey Cloud, a leading blockchain node validation service provider; HashKey Tokenisation, a tokenisation services provider; and HashKey NFT, a Web3 PFP incubation and community operation service provider. Established in 2018, HashKey Group is headquartered in Hong Kong, with operations in Singapore and Tokyo. The Group provides innovative investment opportunities and end-to-end solutions in digital assets and the Web3 ecosystem to retail investors, large institutions, family offices, funds, and professional and accredited investors. The Series A financing round attracted new investors, including institutional investors, Web3 institutions, and strategic partners. However, the specific identities of these investors were not disclosed. A notable participant in the funding round is reported to be OKX Ventures, the investment arm of the OKX digital-asset exchange, though no official confirmation was provided. This funding round marks a significant achievement for HashKey Group, especially considering the recent challenges faced by the crypto venture capital space, marked by a downturn in 2022 following market volatility and high-profile bankruptcies.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-16",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Deepfake Scams on the Rise Michael Saylor, the Chairman of MicroStrategy, recently warned his 3.2 million followers about the proliferation of deepfake videos on YouTube. These AI-generated videos falsely portray Saylor promoting Bitcoin scams, a growing trend that poses a significant threat to the cryptocurrency community. In a notable post on X (formerly Twitter), Saylor emphasized, \u201CThere is no risk-free way to double your #bitcoin, and @MicroStrategy doesn\u2019t give away $BTC to those who scan a barcode\u201D. The Threat of AI in Cryptocurrency Scams The use of artificial intelligence in creating deepfake videos has become a tool for fraudsters. These sophisticated scams show prominent figures like Saylor, urging viewers to scan a barcode and send Bitcoin, falsely promising to double their investment. Saylor's security team reportedly takes down about 80 fake AI-generated YouTube videos daily, yet scammers persistently create more. Previous Incidents This tactic isn't new in the cryptocurrency world. In November 2023, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was targeted by similar AI-generated scams. The increasing sophistication of these scams, leveraging AI technology, requires the crypto community to be vigilant. Users are advised to verify sources and be skeptical of unrealistic promises, especially when they involve sending funds to unknown addresses or platforms promising high returns. Saylor's Personal and MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Holdings Amidst these warnings, it's notable that Saylor recently revealed selling $216 million of MicroStrategy's shares, planning to buy more Bitcoin for his personal holdings. As of December 2023, his software intelligence firm reported holding 189,150 bitcoins. The Double-Edged Sword of AI The rise of AI technology, while offering numerous benefits across various industries, also presents a dual nature. Its ability to create convincing deepfakes has become a potent tool for deception, particularly in the digital currency space. As AI continues to evolve, so does the necessity for individuals and organizations to remain vigilant against digital deception. Conclusion In conclusion, the increasing use of deepfake technology in cryptocurrency scams highlights a significant threat to investors. Saylor's proactive approach in warning the public and actively combating these scams underscores the need for awareness and vigilance in the digital age. It's crucial for investors to practice due diligence, verifying the authenticity of information and being wary of schemes that sound too good to be true. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-15",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On January 14, 2024, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex effectively averted a significant security threat, successfully preventing an exploit attempt that targeted nearly $15 billion worth of XRP. This event underscores the persistent challenges and security risks in the realm of digital currencies. The core of this incident was a \"partial payments exploit,\" a known vulnerability in the XRP ledger's partial payments feature. An anonymous attacker sought to leverage this vulnerability by exploiting a potential misconfiguration in Bitfinex's system. Typically, in such exploits, the attacker relies on the victim's system reading only the \"amount\" field of an XRP transaction, which is intentionally set to a high value. However, the actual amount sent is significantly lower, aiming to deceive the recipient into crediting a larger amount. This attempted exploit was first reported by Whale Alert, a blockchain transaction monitoring service, which noted a transaction of 25.6 billion XRP, almost half of XRP's circulating supply, from an unidentified wallet to Bitfinex. However, Whale Alert later retracted this report, attributing the error to a misreading of the Ripple node response. Bitfinex's Chief Technology Officer, Paolo Ardoino, confirmed the incident, shedding light on the company's effective defense mechanisms. Ardoino clarified that Bitfinex's systems had been correctly configured to handle the 'delivered_amount' data field, effectively neutralizing the exploit attempt. Furthermore, it was revealed that the same attacker had also attempted a similar exploit against Binance, involving a transfer of 58.9 billion XRP. This attempt, like the one at Bitfinex, was unsuccessful, showcasing the robust security measures employed by leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The incident is a stark reminder of the continuous security threats facing the cryptocurrency industry. Exchanges, holding substantial value, are often the targets of sophisticated cyber-attacks. This necessitates an ongoing evolution and enhancement of security protocols to protect assets. The role of blockchain tracking services, such as Whale Alert, has also been highlighted. While these services offer valuable insights into significant transactions, they are not infallible, as demonstrated by this incident. It emphasizes the importance of accurate reporting and verification in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market and the influx of new users underscore the paramount importance of security. Exchanges like Bitfinex and Binance are leading the way in implementing state-of-the-art security measures to shield their platforms and users from such threats. This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the necessity for vigilance and continuous improvement in security measures within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-15",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Celsius Network, a major cryptocurrency lending platform, transferred over $125 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) to various exchanges, a move that has sparked significant curiosity and speculation in the crypto world. According to Arkham Intelligence, Celsius deposited approximately $95.5 million in ETH to Coinbase and transferred an additional $29.73 million to FalconX, leaving it with about 539,000 ETH tokens valued at around $1.38 billion. This substantial transfer follows Celsius's declaration of bankruptcy, highlighting a shift in its strategy towards liquidating assets to meet its liabilities under the bankruptcy proceedings. The company, which had been a dominant player in the cryptocurrency lending market, found itself in financial turmoil, leading to this drastic measure. Celsius's bankruptcy announcement has been a critical point in its ongoing financial challenges. Despite the sizeable transactions, the company retains a significant cryptocurrency portfolio, including over 539,000 ETH and 9,800 BTC, indicating a broader strategy to manage its assets amid financial restructuring. The movement of such a large volume of ETH into the market by Celsius could potentially exert downward pressure on its value. However, the recent approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF and the ensuing rally in the altcoin market have somewhat mitigated this effect. ETH's value increased by 13% over the past week, indicating resilience in the face of these large-scale asset movements. Celsius wasn\u2019t the only firm moving crypto holdings to exchanges. Bankrupt entities FTX and Alameda Research also transferred significant funds to centralized exchanges, totaling $28.2 million in digital assets. This includes 402.6 Wrapped Bitcoin, 3,200 Ethereum, and other digital assets. Like Celsius, these firms have been attempting to manage their assets to repay creditors and affected customers. The crypto market is closely monitoring Celsius\u2019s strategy in dealing with its financial challenges. The impact of its actions, especially on the Ethereum market, is of significant interest given the platform\u2019s considerable holdings in the cryptocurrency. The bearish sentiments and the decline in CEL\u2019s value have led many traders to close their positions, reflecting the market's response to these developments. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Hedera Global Governing Council, overseeing the Hedera network, has recently announced a significant move in the cryptocurrency space. It has approved the allocation of 4.86 billion Hedera (HBAR) \u2014 the network's native cryptocurrency \u2014 valued at approximately $408 million, aimed at further development and advancing decentralized governance. This strategic decision aligns with Hedera\u2019s goal to strengthen its base following its impressive 2023 performance, which saw over 33 billion real-world transactions on the network. The lion's share of the funds, accounting for 4.248 billion HBAR, is earmarked for existing initiatives such as the HBAR Foundation, the Hashgraph Association, and the DLT Science Foundation. Additionally, a portion of the allocation, precisely 614.06 million HBAR, is designated for the operational costs of the Hedera Council and to compensate early simple agreements for future token (SAFT) buyers. This underscores the council's commitment to operational efficiency and rewarding early supporters of the network. The council's chief financial officer, Betsabe Botaitis, outlined in a blog post that the grants for the HBAR Foundation and the Hashgraph Association are scheduled for disbursement in the first quarter of 2024. The DLT Science Foundation will receive its grants as it hits crucial milestones during the year, emphasizing the performance-based approach of the council. Botaitis also highlighted the critical role of ecosystem partners in driving Hedera\u2019s rapid adoption, expressing satisfaction with the established foundation and the council\u2019s readiness to continue supporting network development through these new grants. In a related development, the HBAR Foundation and the Algorand Foundation have joined forces to create the DeRec Alliance. This alliance, unveiled on January 11, aims to develop a decentralized recovery system for digital assets. It signifies the collaborative efforts within the crypto industry to enhance security and recovery processes for digital assets, aligning them with conventional digital experiences. This move by the Hedera Council reflects a strategic focus on enhancing the Hedera network's robustness and governance structures, preparing it for future growth and expansion in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-15",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, has openly criticized Vanguard's decision to exclude Bitcoin ETFs from its offerings. This stance by Vanguard, a behemoth in the investment sector, diverges sharply from the growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrency in mainstream financial portfolios. Wood's criticism is not just a singular voice but a reflection of a larger shift in investor preferences and market dynamics. Vanguard's Conservative Stance on Cryptocurrency Vanguard, known for its traditional investment philosophy, has maintained a conservative approach towards cryptocurrency investments. This firm stance is aligned with the company's long-standing policy of risk aversion and focus on generating real, positive long-term returns for investors. However, this decision has sparked considerable debate within the financial community, as it seems to overlook the burgeoning significance of decentralized monetary systems like Bitcoin. Cathie Wood's Stance Cathie Wood, at the forefront of investment in disruptive technologies, described Vanguard's decision as a \"terrible\" move. In her view, it deprives investors of the opportunity to engage with a significant, decentralized monetary system like Bitcoin. Wood's critique goes beyond mere opinion, highlighting a notable shift in customer behavior. Following Vanguard's reaffirmation of its crypto-averse policy, a significant number of users began moving away from Vanguard to platforms offering Bitcoin ETFs. This customer shift underscores a growing demand for crypto-related investment products among modern investors. The Social Media Backlash Vanguard's stance has triggered substantial backlash on various social media platforms, with movements like #BoycottVanguard gaining traction. This public dissatisfaction has extended beyond social media, with advocates for Bitcoin encouraging investors to transfer their assets to more crypto-friendly platforms. Given these developments, industry analysts suggest that Vanguard might eventually reconsider its position due to the changing market dynamics. Ark Invest's Strategic Moves and Optimism Amid this backdrop, Ark Invest has been making strategic moves in the cryptocurrency space. The firm sold its holdings in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and invested heavily in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. This shift reflects Ark Invest's cautious yet forward-looking approach amid the current regulatory environment. Furthermore, Ark Invest has recently received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin ETF, with an ambitious target of Bitcoin reaching a valuation of $1.5 million by 2030. Conclusion The controversy surrounding Vanguard's decision to exclude Bitcoin ETFs highlights a pivotal moment in the investment world. As the landscape of investments continues to evolve with the increasing integration of digital assets, traditional investment giants like Vanguard may need to reassess their strategies. Meanwhile, firms like Ark Invest are embracing the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies, signaling a significant shift in the industry's outlook towards these emerging financial technologies.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Virginia State Senate has introduced a significant piece of legislation, Senate Bill No. 339, aimed at regulating digital asset mining and transactions. Proposed by Senator Saddam Azlan Salim on January 10, 2024, this bill seeks to amend existing sections and add new ones to the Code of Virginia, specifically addressing areas like digital asset mining, the use and transfer of digital assets, securities exemption, and tax exemption. A key aspect of the bill is its provision regarding digital asset mining. According to the bill, no person shall be required to obtain a license for engaging in digital asset mining or related business activities as defined in Section 15.2-2288.9 of the Code. This section clarifies the legality of home digital asset mining, provided it complies with local noise ordinances. It also states that local industrial zones cannot prohibit digital asset mining activities, provided these comply with applicable general industrial noise ordinances. In terms of tax treatment, the bill proposes a significant change. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, individuals can subtract up to $200 per transaction of any net capital gain from exchanges made using digital assets to purchase goods or services. This amount is subject to annual adjustment based on changes in the United States Average Consumer Price Index. The introduction of Senate Bill No. 339 represents a forward-thinking approach to the regulation of digital assets. By exempting individuals and businesses from money transmitter licenses and safeguarding miners from discrimination in industrial zones, the bill acknowledges the growing relevance of digital assets in today\u2019s economy. Moreover, the tax treatment adjustments reflect an attempt to adapt traditional financial regulations to the evolving landscape of digital transactions. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has approved several spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), a move that marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrency. This development comes after years of hesitation and outright rejections of similar proposals, underscoring the evolving nature of digital asset regulation and the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Background of the Decision The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, 2024, was largely influenced by a legal battle with Grayscale, an asset management firm. In August 2023, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale, declaring the SEC's previous denial of its spot bitcoin ETF application as \u201Carbitrarily and capriciously\u201D executed. This court decision was pivotal in altering the SEC's stance on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Gensler's Reluctant Approval Gary Gensler, known for his cautious approach towards cryptocurrencies, acknowledged the influence of the Grayscale court victory in the SEC\u2019s decision-making process. He emphasized the Commission's commitment to acting within the law and how the courts interpret it, indicating that the Grayscale ruling was a key factor in moving forward with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Despite this, Gensler reiterated that the SEC's approval did not constitute an endorsement of Bitcoin or the broader cryptocurrency market. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is a monumental step for the cryptocurrency market, signaling a potential shift in regulatory attitudes towards digital assets. This decision could pave the way for more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies in mainstream financial markets, offering investors a regulated and potentially safer avenue to invest in Bitcoin. The Future of Digital Asset Regulation While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is a significant milestone, it also highlights the complexities and evolving nature of digital asset regulation. Gensler's cautious remarks underscore the ongoing challenges regulators face in balancing investor protection with the innovative potential of cryptocurrencies. This decision may also prompt further discussions and developments in crypto regulation, as the market continues to mature and gain legitimacy. Conclusion The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, influenced by Grayscale's legal victory, represents a pivotal moment in the regulation of digital assets. It reflects a growing recognition of cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial system and sets a precedent for future regulatory decisions in the crypto space. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "articleSummary": "Venezuela ends its Petro cryptocurrency, a failed oil-backed digital currency initiative aimed at evading U.S. sanctions. Launched in 2018, it struggled for adoption due to legal issues, limited functionality, and lack of international interest.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Venezuelan government has officially announced the cessation of its national cryptocurrency, the Petro (PTR), effective January 15, 2024. Launched in 2018, the Petro was touted as an oil-backed digital currency aimed at circumventing U.S. sanctions and alleviating the economic pressures from the devaluation of the bolivar, Venezuela\u2019s fiat currency. However, the Petro\u2019s journey has been fraught with challenges, ultimately leading to its discontinuation. The Petro's Struggle for Adoption The Petro, despite being a pioneering concept, struggled to achieve mass adoption. Introduced at a time when Bitcoin had already established a significant presence in Venezuela, the Petro was unable to displace or even complement the growing popularity of established cryptocurrencies. Its issuance was mandated by President Nicolas Maduro, yet it faced opposition from the parliament and was never declared legal tender. This lack of mandatory acceptance severely limited its domestic usage. Legal and Operational Challenges The Petro\u2019s journey was marred by several legal and operational hurdles. Notable among them was the arrest of Joselit Ramirez Camacho, the head of Venezuela\u2019s crypto regulator, on charges related to financial crimes in the national oil industry. Additionally, the Petro's management faced allegations of involvement in international narcotics trading, which further tarnished its reputation and hindered its adoption. Petro's Limited Functionality and International Rejection The Petro was never traded abroad, despite efforts to promote it to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America. Domestically, its usage was restricted to certain state operations, such as the payment of taxes and traffic fines, but practical application remained limited. For example, fines levied in Petros could not be paid using the cryptocurrency itself, highlighting its operational limitations. Closure and Transition to Bolivars With the Petro's closure, all crypto wallets on the Patria Platform, previously the sole trading platform for the Petro, will be shut down. The remaining Petros are being converted to bolivars, marking an end to Venezuela\u2019s experiment with an oil-backed digital currency. This transition reflects the broader challenges of implementing national cryptocurrencies, particularly in economically and politically volatile environments. Conclusion The Petro's story is a cautionary tale about the complexities of introducing a national cryptocurrency. It underscores the importance of legal credibility, broad-based acceptance, and practical functionality in the success of such digital currencies. The Petro\u2019s cessation is a significant moment in the history of digital currencies, highlighting the challenges faced by state-backed cryptocurrencies in gaining legitimacy and adoption.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Helium Farm, a prominent player in crypto-mining, recently announced the introduction of three distinct mining plans. These plans are tailored to provide investors with attractive returns based on the current market price of Helium (HNT). Plan Details Mobile Plan ($435\/year): This plan is designed to yield high returns, projecting daily returns of 0.40 to 1.10 HNT, which translates to approximately $2.5 to $6.80 per day based on current HNT values. Cluster Plan ($3,765\/year): The premium option in the trio, the Cluster Plan, offers the most lucrative returns, with an anticipated daily return of 4.10 to 10.90 HNT. This equates to roughly $25.4 to $67.60 daily. These plans include zero maintenance costs and cover installation and hosting services, ensuring a 24-hour seamless mining experience. Helium Farm facilitates passive income through daily HNT payouts, combined with exceptional service and robust data security. Financial Projections The financial attractiveness of these plans remains strong even in adverse market conditions. For example, if the HNT price falls to $5, the Mobile Plan would still yield $2 to $5.50 per day, while the Cluster Plan could offer $20.50 to $54.50 daily. In a more optimistic scenario, with HNT reaching $10, the returns could be significantly higher. Exclusive Services Helium Farm is not just about offering mining plans. They provide robust data security, ensuring a secure environment for users\u2019 information. The platform believes in effortless withdrawals with transaction processing within a day. They also offer comprehensive transaction analytics and round-the-clock customer service. Growth and Expansion Helium Farm's optimism is buoyed by the increasing demand for decentralized wireless networks and the expansion of IoT technology. The Helium Network, particularly in regions like Miami, has seen remarkable growth with the deployment of mobile hotspots, contributing significantly to the network\u2019s coverage and capacity. Helium Farm offers a unique opportunity for investors in the cryptocurrency mining sector. With its managed Hotspot hosting services, it caters to tailored investment plans and handles all hardware-related concerns, thereby simplifying the mining process. Their commitment to security and customer satisfaction, along with the potential for high returns, positions Helium Farm as a promising investment avenue in the HNT mining industry.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Hut 8, a prominent digital asset mining company in North America, just announced a significant amendment and restatement of its credit facility with Coinbase, marking a pivotal moment in the digital asset financing realm, according to PRNewswire. This new arrangement has increased the total loan amount to $65 million, an addition of $15 million to the existing credit line. This development is particularly notable for its use of Bitcoin as collateral, underscoring the evolving landscape of digital asset utilization in corporate finance. Overview of the Deal Hut 8, alongside its subsidiary Hut 8 Mining Corp., renegotiated its credit facility with a Coinbase subsidiary. The revised terms offer a $15 million extension, culminating in a $65 million loan under the amended facility. This move aligns with Hut 8's strategy to leverage its Bitcoin holdings for liquidity, avoiding outright sales while maintaining exposure to potential cryptocurrency appreciations. Such strategies are increasingly crucial for navigating market fluctuations. Financial Implications The loan arrangement carries an interest rate pegged to the higher of the federal funds rate on the borrowing date or 3.25%, with an additional 5.0%. The maturity of the credit facility is set at 364 days following the initial borrowing. Hut 8's innovative approach, using Bitcoin as collateral held by Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, speaks volumes about the growing acceptance and institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. Hut 8's Strategic Direction Hut 8's business model, focusing on Bitcoin mining and hosting, along with high-performance computing, illustrates a forward-thinking approach in digital asset utilization. With eleven sites, including high-performance computing data centers and Bitcoin mining facilities, Hut 8 stands at the forefront of merging infrastructure, energy, and emerging technologies like AI and machine learning. Legal and Regulatory Considerations: The legal framework surrounding digital assets as collateral is still in its developmental stages. This agreement between Hut 8 and Coinbase's subsidiary is pioneering in its handling of digital asset custody and security interests. Investors and stakeholders should closely monitor the evolving legal and regulatory landscape affecting such innovative financial instruments. Market Impact and Institutional Involvement: This deal between Hut 8 and Coinbase might signal growing confidence in the stability and future value of Bitcoin. It sets a precedent for similar agreements and could catalyze increased institutional involvement in the digital asset sector. The ability to use cryptocurrency holdings as leverage for liquidity could become a benchmark for future transactions. Image source: Shutterstock"

Scaramucci predicts Bitcoin will surpass its all-time high, bolstered by the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Recently, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and CEO of SkyBridge Capital as well as a former communications director for the White House, said that the year 2023 was the most profitable year in the history of his hedge fund, according to CNBC. After making a strategic change towards cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), this accomplishment was accomplished. There was a spectacular gain of nearly 130% in the fund's investment in these digital assets, with its Bitcoin-focused funds alone witnessing a growth of roughly 127%. The faith that Scaramucci has in cryptocurrencies is not just founded on their historical performance, but also on his view of the potential that they will have in the future. He is of the opinion that the continuation of the upward trend in cryptocurrency prices throughout the year 2024 will be driven by worldwide acceptance as well as the growing popularity of digital wallets. In order to do this, he forecasts that Bitcoin will exceed its all-time high of $69,000, which was reached in November 2021, by the end of the year and may even reach new heights by the beginning of the following year. The fund, which had been experiencing difficulties in the previous year, saw a big reversal after the year 2023. The expectation that surrounded the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was a major factor that contributed to the comeback of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is widely acknowledged that the recent approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a significant breakthrough for the cryptocurrency industry. The use of Bitcoin by mainstream finance may increase as a result of this move, which makes it simpler for average investors to access the cryptocurrency. Scaramucci emphasised the significance of the decision made by the SEC, pointing out that it does not imply an endorsement of Bitcoin but rather effectively legitimises it by enabling individual investors to access it via brokerage accounts. He declared his desire to be a \"ceremonial buyer\" of the newly licenced exchange-traded fund (ETF), which reflects his confidence for the growth of Bitcoin in the future. This optimistic attitude on cryptocurrencies is a part of a larger trend that is characterised by an increased interest on the part of institutions concerning the digital asset area. A increasing faith in the durability and potential of cryptocurrencies is shown by the success of the hedge fund and Scaramucci's projections. This confidence is developing even in the face of possible hurdles like as regulatory measures. In conclusion, the fact that SkyBridge Capital's cryptocurrency investments for the year 2023 were successful and that an optimistic projection was made about the future of Bitcoin demonstrates that there has been a substantial change in the way digital assets are seen and used. As a result of the ongoing evolution of the market, investors are presented with possibilities as well as problems as they navigate this dynamic and more prominent industry.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a recent interview with CNBC, Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, projected a significant rise in the value of Bitcoin by 2030. According to her forecast, Bitcoin could reach approximately $600,000 under base scenarios. More optimistically, considering factors such as a potential bull market and the possibility of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval, she expanded her projections to an ambitious level of $1.5 million. The Rationale Behind the Prediction Wood's prediction is underpinned by several factors. She cites increasing institutional acceptance and Bitcoin's finite supply and decentralized nature as key drivers. Bitcoin, often referred to as \"digital gold,\" is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties, contributing to its appeal for investors. Wood remains optimistic about Bitcoin overcoming regulatory challenges, anticipating a more supportive environment as the regulatory landscape evolves. Institutional Adoption and Market Dynamics Bitcoin's attractiveness as an investment option is further bolstered by the growing interest from both institutional and retail investors. Wood underscores the cryptocurrency's inflation hedging capabilities and utility in remittances as central to its rising value. Historically, Bitcoin has functioned more as a speculative asset than a common currency, but this perspective is changing with increased adoption and recognition. SEC and Crypto Regulation The SEC's role in the cryptocurrency market cannot be understated. With ongoing regulatory actions and lawsuits, such as the case against Ripple, the regulatory landscape is poised to have a significant impact on the market. Market analysts suggest that approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs could positively influence Bitcoin's price by boosting investor confidence through regulatory clarity. Such developments could pave the way for Bitcoin's rise as projected by Wood. Bitcoin's Current Market Position As of now, Bitcoin is a leader in the digital currency market, valued at around $42,375. Its market trend appears to be bullish above the $41,735 mark, with resistance levels noted at $42,885, $44,738, and $46,020. Support levels are at $40,700, $39,775, and $38,350. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reflects a neutral market stance, and the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is in close proximity to Bitcoin's price, suggesting a possibility of short-term bullish movement Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, representing Massachusetts and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has publicly condemned the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its approval of 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This decision by the SEC has sparked a significant debate regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system and the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks. Senator Warren, known for her cautious approach towards cryptocurrencies, argued that the SEC's decision was \"wrong on the law and wrong on the policy.\" She believes that allowing cryptocurrencies to penetrate deeper into the financial system without strict anti-money laundering regulations poses a significant risk. In response, Warren has been actively promoting her Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, aiming to extend the Bank Secrecy Act requirements to digital asset entities. She stated, If the SEC is going to let crypto burrow even deeper into our financial system, then it's more urgent than ever that crypto follow basic anti-money laundering rules. The act, reintroduced in October, has gained support from 19 Senators, including two Republicans. However, it has faced criticism from some members of the crypto industry who argue that it could stifle innovation and drive companies offshore. Warren's critique comes amid mixed reactions from other lawmakers. Some, like House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and digital assets subcommittee head French Hill, R-Ark., have expressed rare praise for the SEC, stating that the approval marks a significant improvement and provides greater access to this generational technology. The approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, headed by Chair Gary Gensler, a historic crypto skeptic, was more a result of legal constraints than personal acceptance. Gensler highlighted the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which stated that the Commission had failed to adequately explain its reasoning in disapproving previous ETP applications. Despite this, Gensler remains cautious, viewing bitcoin as volatile, speculative, and a potential tool for illicit financial activities. This event marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over the regulation and integration of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. financial system. It raises critical questions about the balance between innovation and regulation, the role of governmental agencies in overseeing emerging financial products, and the future trajectory of the crypto market.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The recent developments in the FTX bankruptcy case highlight a complex and painful situation for its customers, contrasting starkly with the broader revival of the cryptocurrency market. FTX, once a prominent player in the crypto exchange world, filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, revealing a massive shortfall in its accounts. This event sent shockwaves through the crypto community and had far-reaching implications for investors and the market at large. FTX's collapse was marked by revelations of misused customer funds, leading to billions of dollars in losses. As a result, the bankruptcy proceedings have been closely watched by both customers hoping to recover their funds and industry observers gauging the impact on the broader crypto market. In a recent development, the U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved FTX's request to reimburse a group of non-U.S. creditors for legal fees, acknowledging their role in negotiating a settlement among competing groups of FTX customers. The approved settlement earmarked at least 90% of FTX's recovered assets to repay customers, addressing the division of these assets between U.S. and international customers. However, it's clear that neither group will be fully compensated for their losses. This outcome is particularly disheartening for FTX's international customers, who were hit harder by the funding shortfall that led to the exchange's collapse. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery, with Bitcoin more than doubling in price in 2023. This revival, driven by growing excitement about the U.S. regulator potentially approving spot bitcoin ETFs and the expected end of rate hikes, presents a stark contrast to the plight of FTX customers. The overall crypto market value has also seen a significant uptick, recovering from a low of $796 billion to hover above $1 trillion. The FTX saga has had a profound impact on the crypto landscape, affecting investor confidence and regulatory scrutiny. The case of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, convicted of stealing billions from customer accounts, serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in the still-evolving crypto market. FTX's agreement with Bahamian liquidators to pool assets and harmonize the approach to valuing customer claims is a crucial step in addressing the complexities of its bankruptcy. This settlement aims to accelerate the return of funds to customers and avoid years of protracted litigation. Nonetheless, the agreement highlights the challenges of navigating bankruptcy proceedings in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. In conclusion, while the broader crypto market shows signs of resilience and growth, FTX's customers remain mired in uncertainty and loss. This contrast underscores the need for robust regulatory frameworks and vigilant risk management in the crypto industry. As the FTX case continues to unfold, it serves as a cautionary tale for investors and a benchmark for industry standards. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Robert Kiyosaki, the acclaimed author of \"Rich Dad Poor Dad,\" has once again made headlines with his bullish forecast for Bitcoin's future value. Kiyosaki predicts that the price of Bitcoin will surge to $150,000, a statement that has sparked intense discussion and speculation within the financial community. This prediction is particularly noteworthy given the upcoming 2024 Bitcoin halving event, an occurrence known for historically influencing Bitcoin's value. He stated, BITCOIN ETF. Yay. Glad I bought years ago. Bitcoin to $150k soon. Gold to the moon as Central Banks buy , store, and never sell. Silver to crash as silver stackers sell to pay bills, caused by rising inflation. Great news for silver stackers. Time to buy more as silver crashes. It\u2019s all good news except for losers who save fake fiat US dollars. I will be buying more gold, silver, & Bitcoin with fake dollars. Kiyosaki's outlook on Bitcoin is rooted in his broader economic perspective. He views Bitcoin, along with gold and silver, as robust hedges against what he perceives as rampant inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. This stance is consistent with his long-held skepticism towards traditional fiat money, especially since the U.S. dollar departed from the gold standard in 1971. His prediction extends even further into the future, foreseeing a potential price point of $1.2 million for Bitcoin in the next five years. This long-term view underscores his belief in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies as a countermeasure against economic instability and inflation. Beyond his faith in Bitcoin, Kiyosaki has expressed concerns about the broader market. He anticipates that traditional investment strategies, particularly the conventional 60\/40 bond\/stock portfolio, may falter in the face of what he describes as \"the greatest crash in world history.\" In response, he advocates a radical shift in investment strategy, suggesting a heavier reliance on gold, silver, and Bitcoin, combined with investments in real estate or oil stocks. However, it's crucial to contextualize these predictions within the larger financial landscape. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and Bitcoin's price is influenced by a multitude of factors, including regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market sentiment. The proposed Bitcoin ETF, which Kiyosaki cites as a key driver for his prediction, could indeed enhance institutional access to Bitcoin, potentially increasing demand. Yet, the market's response to such regulatory changes remains uncertain. Furthermore, the impact of the Bitcoin halving in 2024 is a subject of debate. While historical data suggests a correlation between halving events and price increases, the unique market conditions of each cycle mean past trends are not guaranteed to repeat. In conclusion, while Kiyosaki's predictions are grounded in his interpretations of economic trends and market dynamics, they represent just one perspective in the complex and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency investing. As with any speculative forecast, investors should approach these predictions with caution, conducting thorough research and considering a diverse range of viewpoints before making any investment decisions.

On January 11, 2024, Bitwise Asset Management, renowned as the largest crypto index fund manager in the United States, commenced trading of its first spot bitcoin ETF, BITB. This event heralds a new chapter in investment options for U.S. investors, offering an accessible route to investing in bitcoin through a regulated, traditional exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Furthermore, in a move to attract investors, Bitwise has decided to reduce the fee to 0% for the first six months for the initial $1 billion in assets under management. This strategic pricing positions BITB competitively, potentially influencing the broader market of cryptocurrency-based ETFs. Risks and Considerations As with any investment, there are risks associated with BITB. The fund is nondiversified, meaning it may hold fewer portfolio securities compared to other products. This could lead to higher volatility in the fund's value. Additionally, being a new fund, it presents a recency risk with limited historical data for investors to consider. BITB is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936. Therefore, shareholders do not have certain protections typically associated with shares in registered investment companies. Moreover, the value of the ETF is closely tied to the price of bitcoin, which is known for its high volatility. Potential investors should carefully evaluate their ability to withstand significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. The Bitwise Ecosystem Bitwise Asset Management has been a pioneering force in the crypto investment space. Over the past six years, the company has developed a diverse range of investment products, including the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH), and the Bitwise Web3 ETF (BWEB). Their products cater to a wide range of investors, from financial advisors to family offices and institutional investors, providing comprehensive access to crypto markets. Furthermore, Bitwise has pledged to allocate 10% of the profits from BITB to support Bitcoin open-source development. This initiative underscores the company's commitment to the growth and sustainability of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Broader Implications The launch of BITB is a significant development in the broader context of cryptocurrency acceptance in regulated financial markets. It follows a longstanding debate and anticipation around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States. BITB's entry into the market could pave the way for more cryptocurrency-based investment products, offering traditional investors a more familiar and regulated path to investing in digital assets.

        "articleSummary": "South Korea reaffirms its prohibition of local financial institutions from owning, buying, or investing in cryptocurrencies and businesses offering crypto, including a strict ban on cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs).",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "South Korea has reasserted its stringent position on virtual currency investments. The country's top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), has unequivocally stated that it will continue to enforce its policy that restricts financial institutions from launching cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This stance comes despite the increasing global acceptance of cryptocurrencies and the approval of crypto ETFs in the United States. The Financial Services Commission has articulated that the decision to uphold the ban is rooted in the need to ensure the stability of financial markets and protect investors. According to local media reports, an official of the FSC highlighted that the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. does not influence Korea's regulatory approach. The regulator's firm stance reflects a cautious attitude towards the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and a commitment to safeguarding the traditional financial system. South Korea's existing capital markets act limits the scope of underlying assets for investment contract securities, such as ETFs, to traditional financial investment instruments, currencies, and commodities. Cryptocurrencies, not being recognized as financial assets in South Korea, fall outside the purview of permissible investments for financial institutions. This policy has been in place since 2017 and remains a cornerstone of South Korea's approach to managing the risks associated with digital currencies. In addition to the ETF ban, South Korea is also working on comprehensive crypto regulation, which is being developed in two parts. The first part of this regulation, passed last year, is set to come into effect in July 2024. This legislation will establish clear rules regarding the issuance, listing, and delisting of cryptocurrencies. The second part of the regulation is still under construction and aims to further refine the legal framework governing digital assets. Another significant aspect of South Korea's regulatory framework is the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, scheduled to be enforced from July 19, 2024. This Act will enforce specific regulations for improved user safety and market stability in the virtual asset sector. Notably, the Financial Services Commission has declared that NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) are exempt from these regulations. The recent developments indicate a cautious but evolving approach by South Korean authorities towards cryptocurrency and digital assets. While maintaining strict control over traditional financial institutions' involvement in crypto, the government is also laying down a foundation for a regulated and secure environment for digital asset transactions.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved eleven spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a significant milestone in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial markets. Of these, eight are in partnership with Coinbase, highlighting the platform's critical role in this development. Historical Context and Significance This decision by the SEC is seen as a watershed moment for the crypto economy, particularly Bitcoin. Coinbase, a major player in the cryptocurrency world, has been appointed the custodian for these newly approved ETFs. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is not only a recognition of Bitcoin's growing legitimacy as an asset class but also a response to the persistent demand from investors for regulated crypto investment vehicles. Such ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. Coinbase's Role and Security Measures Coinbase's role as a custodian is crucial, given its long history of securely storing assets for both retail and institutional customers. The company provides robust cybersecurity and legal protections for assets stored in its custody. The approval of these ETFs is expected to attract institutional volume to Bitcoin and potentially other cryptocurrencies, further cementing their place in mainstream finance. Alesia Haas's Perspectives Alesia Haas, CFO of Coinbase, underscores the importance of this development. She notes the increasing adoption of crypto assets in the U.S., with over 52 million Americans owning them. Haas emphasizes that Coinbase's priority is the security of investors' investments and highlights their comprehensive approach to cybersecurity and operational safety. Regulatory and Investor Implications The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is seen as a step forward in the ongoing effort to bring regulatory clarity to the cryptocurrency sector. It's a move that not only legitimizes the crypto market but also opens it to a broader base of investors who prefer traditional financial products. This development is expected to introduce a significant amount of capital into the crypto market that was previously inaccessible due to regulatory constraints. Future Prospects and Challenges While this development is a positive step for the crypto economy, challenges remain, such as the need for continued regulatory clarity and addressing cybersecurity concerns. The approval may also pave the way for the introduction of other crypto-related investment products, further expanding the market's reach and potential. In conclusion, the SEC's approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs, with Coinbase as a key custodian, represents a significant stride in the crypto industry's journey towards mainstream acceptance and integration into the global financial ecosystem. It highlights the evolving nature of cryptocurrency as an investable asset class and the growing intersection between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "With the launch of the DeRec Alliance, a pioneering partnership between the Hedera (HBAR) and Algorand (ALGO) ecosystems, the blockchain world has taken a step forward in recovering your cryptocurrenies. This collaboration took place between the two ecosystems. The goal of this cooperation, which was unveiled at the CFC St. Moritz conference in Switzerland, is to modernize the process of recovering digital assets by making it simpler and more safe for all parties involved. A number of important organizations, including as the HBAR Foundation, the Algorand Foundation, the Hashgraph Association, Swirlds Labs, and the DLT Science Foundation, as well as business partners The Building Blocks and BankSocial, are members of the DeRec Alliance. These organizations come from both the Hedera and Algorand ecosystems. Moving beyond the difficulty of cold storage and self-custody approaches, their primary objective is to build an interoperable recovery standard that will simplify the process of recovering cryptographic assets and other digital assets. Known as the Decentralized Recovery (DeRec) protocol, this new standard offers an open-source solution to the management of keys and other confidential information. When it comes to recovering users' secrets, such as digital assets, accounts, keys, and passwords, it entails secret sharing among a group of helpers (such as friends or companies) who are able to aid users in retrieving their secrets. The information that each helper contributes to this system does not expose any information about the initial secret. Even in situations when they have misplaced their phone or other two-factor recovery devices, users are still able to rebuild their secret with the aid of fifty percent of their helpers. It is not uncommon to lost password in the crypto world. As reported by Blockchain.News, former Ripple executive Stefan Thomas lost the keys to his digital wallet, which held over $240 million worth of Bitcoin. Thomas had recorded the password on a paper but lost it. If he fails to remember the code to unlock the hard drive, his cryptocurrency fortune will be locked up forever. Thomas has only two guesses left before his fortune is irretrievable. A number of additional features are included into the protocol, such as automated periodical confirmations that helpers still hold shares of secrets and automatic re-sharing of secrets if there is a change in the secrets or when helpers join or leave the organisation. Notably, the individuals that assist the user will stay anonymous, and even the individuals who assist the user will not be aware of each other's identities. The DeRec Alliance is a significant step forward in the realm of Web3, with the objective of making the process of safeguarding and recovering digital assets as simple as it is in the Web2 environment. Through the use of this newly developed open-source standard, the members of the alliance are working together to realize the potential of Web3, while minimizing the complications that are often associated with working with it.

His actions, while legal under the STOCK Act, raise questions about ethical implications and the need for stricter regulations in lawmakers' digital asset investments.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "US Georgia Representative Mike Collins disclosed investments totaling up to $65,000 in Ethereum (ETH) in early 2024. This disclosure, filed on January 9 with the House\u2019s Financial Disclosure Reports Database, includes purchases of $15,000 on January 3 and $50,000 on January 8, adding to his total ETH investments of approximately $110,000 since 2023. Collins' engagement with Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, aligns with his ongoing investments in digital assets. The STOCK Act, a regulatory framework designed to prevent conflicts of interest, mandates such disclosures by US lawmakers. However, it does not prohibit them from overseeing legislation potentially related to their investments, which has been a point of contention and debate regarding the intersection of personal wealth and public service responsibilities. The timing of Collins\u2019 investments coincides with a notable surge in Ethereum's price, which experienced an 11% increase in early January 2024. This market behavior is partly attributed to anticipations surrounding the SEC's potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, a development that could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. These financial activities occur against a backdrop of significant political events, including the looming possibility of a US government shutdown and the commencement of the 2024 presidential campaign. The intersection of these political dynamics with market movements underscores the complex relationship between governmental actions and financial markets, particularly in the realm of cryptocurrencies. This development also highlights the broader trend of lawmakers engaging in cryptocurrency investments, reflecting the growing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial practices. However, it raises questions about the need for more stringent regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency and prevent potential conflicts of interest. The ongoing debates in this arena suggest a growing recognition of the unique challenges posed by the intersection of digital assets and political governance. Image source: Shutterstock"

This aligns with Singapore's robust regulatory standards and BitGo's commitment to security in digital asset transactions.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "BitGo, a well-known cryptocurrency custody company, has just been granted clearance in principle by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for a license to operate as a Major Payment Institution (MPI). The firm is now able to provide regulated digital payment token services as a result of this momentous accomplishment, which represents an important milestone in BitGo's ambitions to expand its operations in Singapore. In addition to BitGo's significant achievement in securing a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), several other notable crypto-related companies have also been granted this prestigious license, affirming Singapore's status as a key player in digital asset innovation and regulation. As reported by Blockchain.New, among these are Sygnum Singapore, Coinbase, GSR Markets, Upbit Singapore, Blockchain.com, and Crypto.com, each having successfully navigated Singapore's stringent regulatory framework to secure their MPI licensess. Singapore, which is widely acknowledged as a center for financial innovation, provides a climate that is excellent for the expansion of BitGo. It is possible for BitGo to continue operations while it waits for the complete permission, which will allow it to provide a diverse selection of digital payment token services to its customers in Singapore. The approval in principle permits BitGo to function temporarily. The fact that this is in perfect accordance with the rigorous regulatory structure of the city-state makes it clear that Singapore is dedicated to nurturing an ecosystem that is both safe and compatible with digital asset regulations. The path that BitGo has taken to secure the MPI license is evidence of the company's commitment to complying with the high regulatory requirements that are in place in Singapore. With regard to the Asia-Pacific area, the corporation considers Singapore to be an important hub for the development of digital assets. This move is not just about growing its geographical footprint, but it is also about reaffirming its commitment to security and compliance, which is essential for the subsequent wave of adoption of digital assets. Following BitGo's recent success in obtaining a cryptocurrency custody license in Germany from BaFin in October 2023, the permission was granted because of this accomplishment. This shows the constant efforts that BitGo has made to align itself with worldwide regulatory requirements, helping to ensure that digital asset transactions take place in an environment that is trustworthy and safe. After gaining the complete license, BitGo Singapore Pte. Ltd., the Singaporean subsidiary of BitGo, will provide customers with the chance to purchase and sell digital assets by using BitGo's guaranteed cold storage custody solution. The implementation of this system, which is housed inside a class III vault, promises to improve both operating efficiency and security. BitGo's commitment to provide cutting-edge security measures, which are designed to meet the ever-increasing demand for trustworthy digital asset services throughout the globe, is shown by this. This new initiative is noteworthy when seen in the larger context of Singapore's status as a premier financial hub and a gateway for innovation and business in the Asia-Pacific region. The development of BitGo in Singapore is a reflection of the growing trend of bitcoin usage throughout the world as well as the need for regulated and secure platforms specifically designed for the transaction of digital assets. It also solidifies BitGo's worldwide footprint in the cryptocurrency industry by positioning the company as a leader in the provision of comprehensive, regulated, and secure digital asset services in Singapore.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a key self-regulatory organization in the United States, recently published its 2024 Annual Regulatory Oversight Report. This report is of particular interest due to its inclusion of a dedicated section on crypto assets for the first time, reflecting the growing significance of cryptocurrencies in the financial landscape. This section is aimed at guiding member firms engaged in or planning to engage in crypto-related activities to adhere to compliance standards and SEC regulations. Crypto Asset Developments FINRA's Membership Application Program (MAP) aligns with the SEC's guidelines, focusing on evaluating member firms' business plans in the realm of crypto asset securities. This includes assessing financial responsibility and adherence to customer protection rules. The report provides guidance for firms contemplating engaging in crypto asset-related activities, highlighting the importance of due diligence and compliance with applicable regulations. Advertised Volume and Cybersecurity The report touches on topics such as inflated trade volumes and unreasonable supervision. It also emphasizes the increasing variety, frequency, and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents. Firms are guided on identifying, preventing, and mitigating such incidents. Anti-Money Laundering and Fraud Member firms are required to develop and implement written Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programs. The report outlines the necessary steps to ensure compliance with these programs, along with the need for robust fraud and sanctions screening processes. Retail Communications and Compliance Retail communications involving crypto assets are noted for having a significantly higher non-compliance rate compared to other products. The report suggests that firms establish written policies, procedures, and controls related to crypto asset activities conducted by the firm and its associated persons. Potential Implications of Pending Supreme Court Decision The report mentions a pending Supreme Court decision that could impact regulatory practices involving in-house judges, which could have implications for FINRA's regulatory mechanisms. Implications for the Industry The inclusion of a crypto assets section in FINRA's annual report is a testament to the organization's responsiveness to the dynamic nature of financial markets. By setting compliance standards and providing detailed guidance, FINRA is equipping its members to navigate the complex and rapidly evolving crypto sector.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The biggest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, Inc., has just revealed that the cost for their planned spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) would now be 0.25% instead of 0.30%, according to Reuters. This action is being taken in the middle of a competitive market where several investment managers, such as Ark Investment Management, are fighting for a position in Bitcoin ETFs. For its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, Ark Investment Management has also reduced its fee from 0.25% to 0.21%. The price reductions announced by BlackRock and Ark are indicative of a larger trend in the investment management space, especially with regard to products that are centered on cryptocurrencies. These fee modifications are a part of these companies' deliberate attempt to draw in more capital and get a competitive advantage, particularly in light of the increasing interest in cryptocurrency investments and the impending Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs. This development represents a major change in the financial environment, as major conventional asset management firms are beginning to accept cryptocurrencies as a real asset class. Due to its enormous power and the several trillion dollars in assets it managed, BlackRock's participation stands out in particular. The company's debut into the Bitcoin ETF market has the potential to provide the cryptocurrency industry more credibility and stability. But there's more to this action than merely lowering fees. It also highlights the dynamics of the cryptocurrency sector as a whole and the way in which its regulatory landscape is changing. These asset managers are preparing for a potential spike in investor interest while the SEC awaits its decision on the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The competition among ETF providers over fees highlights how desperate they are to get a piece of the anticipated capital influx into these novel investment vehicles. After they are authorized, the ETFs are meant to provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin without all of the hassles associated with holding a cryptocurrency directly, such storage and security issues. A new generation of investors, ranging from big institutional players to regular retail investors, may be drawn in by this simplicity. Furthermore, this growth coincides with heightened institutional interest and regulatory certainty in the bitcoin space. A market that is developing and progressively assimilating into the larger financial system is shown by the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. To sum up, the lower fees that BlackRock and Ark have suggested for their Bitcoin ETFs represent a major turning point in the development of bitcoin investment products. This calculated action shows how cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more significant in the world of investments and how big businesses are still trying to have a footing in this emerging sector.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "There has been a great amount of controversy and requests for an inquiry to be conducted by the United States authorities as a result of the recent security breach that occurred on the social media account of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This breach led to the fraudulent announcement of an approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). It is important to note that this episode brings to light significant concerns around cybersecurity, market manipulation, and the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Overview of the Incident As a result of the SEC's official social media account being accessed, a bogus announcement was made about the approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This led to a significant surge in the price of Bitcoin. Despite the fact that this illegal article was swiftly discovered and corrected, it had already had a considerable influence on the bitcoin market. Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has acknowledged that the post was made without authorization, and that the account was lost owing to the absence of two-factor authentication. Concerns Regarding the Market and Regulatory Issues As a result of the bogus statement, the price of Bitcoin saw a momentary increase, which exemplifies the huge influence that regulatory news has on cryptocurrency markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) cybersecurity safeguards and its capacity to preserve critical market-affecting information are called into doubt as a result of this occurrence. In spite of the fact that it is well-known for its stringent position on cryptocurrencies and investor safety, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finds itself in a strange situation, since its own security failure has led to worries of market manipulation. Appeals for the Conduct of Investigations and Accountability A comprehensive inquiry of the manner in which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has handled this matter is being demanded by legislators and legal experts in the United States. A number of criticisms have been leveled at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for failing to adhere to its cybersecurity standards and perhaps causing market manipulation. The event was described by Representative Ann Wagner as \"clear market manipulation,\" and other authorities expressed the sentiment that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) must demonstrate responsibility and openness moving forward. This investigation comes at a crucial moment when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to make judgments on multiple applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Examining the Future: Cryptocurrency ETF and the Role of Regulatory Oversight The SEC is under increasing scrutiny as a result of the episode, which has put a shadow on the future decisions involving Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It is with great anticipation that the market awaits the SEC's position on these exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which has the potential to greatly impact the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, this latest security incident highlights the difficulties that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has in striking a balance between the enforcement of regulations and the preservation of market integrity and investor confidence.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, Kraken, Mexc, and Kucoin are among the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges that have been targeted by the Indian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which has taken further measures against them by deleting their applications from the Apple App Store in India. As a result of the enactment of new taxation rules on virtual currencies in the previous year, this new development represents a major step in India's continuing attempts to regulate the cryptocurrency business. Late in the month of December 2023, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) issued show cause letters to nine cryptocurrency companies, stating that they had violated India's anti-money laundering legislation. Huobi, Gate.io, Bittrex, and Bitfinex are all among the nine exchanges that have been targeted. Bitstamp is the only exchange that has been identified whose app is still active in India's App Store. This move by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which is a division of the Indian Ministry of Finance, is a reflection of the growing scrutiny and regulatory pressure that is being applied to the cryptocurrency business in India. The nation implemented a taxation policy in 2023, which included a thirty percent tax on earnings from cryptocurrency transactions and a one percent deduction for each transaction. As a result of the tight regulatory environment, a significant number of dealers in India have shifted their operations to worldwide cryptocurrency platforms, which seems to be an attempt to avoid paying these taxes. Despite this, cryptocurrency exchanges headquartered in India, such as CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX, continue to implement stringent know-your-customer (KYC) verifications. It has been recommended by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) restrict the URLs of these nine cryptocurrency exchanges in India. This is a key step towards putting a stop to the activities of these worldwide platforms inside the nation. This action is being taken with the intention of ensuring that these organizations conform with the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework that is stipulated under India's Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002. By taking these moves, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has shown India's commitment to regulating the cryptocurrency industry and protecting its financial system from the potential hazards that are connected with uncontrolled digital assets. With the intention of delivering a strong message about its position on maintaining compliance within the cryptocurrency industry, the Indian government is targeting key businesses such as Binance and Kraken. CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber, two cryptocurrency exchanges based in India, had earlier issued a warning to the government, stating that the new tax policy might potentially push customers into decentralized exchanges or services that do not comply with the regulations. The government's desire to manage the cryptocurrency market and prohibit any evasion of the legal framework is shown by the recent crackdown that has taken place with this intention. It will be very important to keep a close eye on the reactions of these worldwide exchanges as the situation continues to develop, as well as the influence that this will have on the cryptocurrency market in India as a whole. There is a possibility that the hard posture taken by the Indian government might possibly transform the landscape of digital currency trading in the nation, which would have an impact on both traders and exchanges.

        "articleSummary": "Singapore's MAS has blacklisted ImToken, a crypto wallet provider, for lack of a financial license, citing its role as a decentralized, self-custodial wallet for investor protection and market stability.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Singaporean financial regulatory landscape has recently intensified its scrutiny of cryptocurrency-related businesses, as exemplified by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s decision to blacklist ImToken, a noncustodial crypto wallet provider. This move highlights Singapore's proactive stance in regulating the burgeoning crypto sector, aiming to safeguard investors and uphold financial system stability. ImToken, founded in 2016 and originally based in Hangzhou, China, before moving its headquarters to Singapore, operates a self-custodial wallet. It provides decentralized wallet services worldwide, including in Singapore, and differs from centralized custodial services. Despite its global operations, ImToken did not acquire a financial business license in Singapore, leading to its inclusion on the MAS Investor Alert List (IAL) on December 5, 2023. ImToken's response, communicated via social media platforms, expresses their active engagement with MAS to clarify their business model and seek removal from the IAL. The company emphasizes that, as a decentralized wallet, its users' assets remain unaffected by this development. The MAS's action against ImToken is part of a broader regulatory trend in Singapore, reflecting increasing vigilance in overseeing the crypto sector. This approach follows the inclusion of Binance, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, on the MAS IAL in November 2021. The MAS's focus extends to various aspects of the digital asset ecosystem, including crypto exchanges and noncustodial wallets like ImToken, which offer users more control over their private keys and assets but are perceived as potential risks to investors and the financial system. The blacklisting of ImToken, along with another crypto-related firm, BKEX, underscores the MAS's commitment to investor protection and prevention of illicit activities in the crypto domain. This move serves as a caution to investors to exercise due diligence when engaging with such platforms and as a reminder to crypto businesses of the importance of adhering to local regulations. In response to regulatory concerns, Binance has taken significant steps to comply, including geo-blocking Singapore IP addresses and removing its app from Singapore\u2019s app stores. This indicates the potential path that other affected entities like ImToken might have to follow. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A proposal has been initiated by StakeLab, a key staking and relaying hub, to potentially adjust the minimum inflation rate of ATOM , the Cosmos network's native cryptocurrency, to 0%. This proposal, which was presented on January 9, 2024, aims to revolutionize the tokenomics of ATOM, potentially altering its inflation rate from the current range of 7% to 20% to a new range of 0% to 20%. The driving force behind this proposal is the recognition that the existing minimum inflation rate of 7% is inconsistent with the models of other operational blockchain systems. StakeLab highlights that, under the current system, the network would continue to generate an additional 7% of tokens annually, even if 100% of the token supply were staked. This situation has raised concerns among community members and experts alike, prompting a reevaluation of the token's inflation dynamics. To pass this groundbreaking proposal, it requires a quorum of 40% of ATOM's outstanding supply and a majority of affirmative votes. The voting period spans from January 9 to January 23, 2024. As of now, a significant portion of the community, nearly 95%, has shown support for the proposal, with only 4.4% opposing and a negligible 0.1% exercising their veto. This move towards zero inflation aims to address several critical issues within the Cosmos ecosystem. Firstly, it seeks to mitigate the selling pressure on the ATOM token, which has been a source of consistent price depreciation. Secondly, it endeavors to correct the overpayments for security, bringing the network's costs in line with those of other blockchains. This initiative follows a previous decision in November 2023, where the Cosmos network voted to cap the maximum inflation for ATOM at 10% annually, a strategic maneuver designed to preserve the token's value. The implications of this proposal are manifold. It underscores a commitment to token value preservation and economic sustainability, aligning Cosmos with emerging blockchain models. However, it also introduces new dynamics in token staking and rewards. For instance, two chains based on the Cosmos SDK, DYDX and Kava, which have already implemented 0% inflation, show varied staking participation rates, indicating the complex relationship between inflation rates and staking incentives. The outcome of this proposal, if passed, could set a precedent in the blockchain space, especially for networks grappling with the balance between token inflation, staking rewards, and overall ecosystem health. It reflects the evolving nature of blockchain economics and the continued pursuit of sustainable and efficient economic models within decentralized networks. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Alchemy Pay, a leading fiat-to-crypto payment gateway, has recently expanded its virtual card services in Hong Kong by adding new card Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) for its Crypto Virtual Card, according to official website. This strategic move, marked by the addition of the BIN number \"515783\", is set to significantly enhance the utility and acceptance of the card across various platforms like ChatGPT Plus, Aliexpress, Netflix, Twitter, Facebook, Apple Store, and Google Pay. The implementation of new BINs is a critical development in the crypto payment sector, as these numbers, which constitute the first 6 to 8 digits of a card number, are instrumental in the financial ecosystem. They provide vital information about the card\u2019s network, type (debit or credit), and the issuing bank or financial entity, thus enabling a broader range of payment scenarios and aiming to improve transaction success rates. Alchemy Pay's initiative aligns with Hong Kong's progressive stance on cryptocurrencies. Following the review of policies for intermediaries involved in virtual asset activities by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on December 22, the region has shown readiness to integrate traditional finance funds into the crypto sector. Alchemy Pay is actively seeking a Money Service Operator (MSO) license and Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Hong Kong, indicating its commitment to compliance and regulatory adherence. Partnering with ZD Group, Alchemy Pay has shared essential Financial Services Licenses required for financial investment activities in Hong Kong. The firm has been at the forefront of promoting cryptocurrency awareness in the region, notably through its public service announcement campaign during the Web3 Blockchain Week. Furthermore, Alchemy Pay has integrated with major exchanges like OKX and Bitget, offering Hong Kong users secure and compliant trading options. The introduction of the new card BIN is a step towards simplifying crypto transactions and solidifying Alchemy Pay\u2019s position as a leader in the crypto payment gateway sector. Hong Kong\u2019s evolving regulatory landscape, with guidelines issued in October 2022 and the processing of license requests for crypto trading platforms, indicates the region's ambition to become a global crypto hub. By leveraging these policy advancements, Alchemy Pay continues to innovate and adapt its services, catering to the growing demand for accessible and user-friendly crypto payment solutions. Founded in Singapore in 2017, Alchemy Pay supports payments in 173 countries with solutions like On & Off-Ramp, NFT Checkout, and Crypto Card. The firm's recent expansion in Hong Kong exemplifies its commitment to the global advancement of the crypto payment industry. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Bitcoin's market sentiment score, as indicated by the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, has reached 76 as of January 9, 2024, signaling extreme greed in the market. This is the highest level since 2021 when Bitcoin hit its peak. The index considers various factors like volatility, market momentum, social media sentiment, dominance, and trends The crypto market has seen high volatility at the beginning of 2024, primarily influenced by the market sentiment toward spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). There was a significant sell-off in major cryptocurrencies on January 3rd, largely due to speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might deny the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The anticipation of the SEC's decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a major driver of the recent surge in market sentiment. Bitcoin's value increased notably, surpassing $46,000, in response to this news, marking a significant increase both weekly and yearly. This rally pushed Bitcoin to $47,000 on Monday, causing nearly $150 million worth of short liquidations in the past 24 hours. However, there's a high possibility of extreme volatility due to the pending ETF decisions. The potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs could lead to significant market movements and increased risks. Investors and traders are advised to be cautious and prepared for potential pullbacks. In summary, the current market sentiment score of 76 for Bitcoin reflects the heightened anticipation and excitement surrounding the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs. As the market awaits the SEC\u2019s decision, investors are advised to remain vigilant and consider the potential risks associated with increased market volatility. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Standard Chartered, a prominent global financial institution, has recently made a prediction that Bitcoin might reach over $200,000 by the end of 2025. This prediction is contingent upon the approval and profitability of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. By the end of 2024, it is anticipated that between 437,000 and 1.32 million Bitcoin would be held in spot Bitcoin ETFs that are listed in the United States. This would result in inflows of around $50-100 billion. This forecast is dependent on the assumption that this number will be reached. Geoff Kendrick and Suki Cooper, two executives of the bank, compared the potential development of the bank to the past success of gold exchange-traded funds. They made the observation that the value of these items increased by a factor of 4.3 around seven to eight years after they were first introduced to the market in November of 2004. When this trajectory is applied to Bitcoin, they believe that if the inflows connected to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) materialise as anticipated, then a price level for Bitcoin that is close to $200,000 might be achievable by the end of the year 2025. Kendrick and Cooper consider the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be a momentous occasion representing a \"watershed moment\" in the process of normalising Bitcoin participation. In conjunction with these changes, industry experts stress the need of taking into consideration the stronger network foundations of Bitcoin. A blockchain expert named Jamie Coutts made the observation that Bitcoin's fundamentals are at an all-time high, and that the cryptocurrency's attractiveness is being bolstered by unique use cases like as inscriptions. According to Coutts, Bitcoin's price is still forty percent below its all-time high, indicating that it is undervalued. This is despite the fact that Bitcoin's fundamentals are strong. Keeping this in mind, the projected flood of investment via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might be the catalyst for a significant rise in the price of Bitcoin, which could possibly reach the predicted level of $200,000 by the end of the year 2025.

        "detailedArticleContent": "MicroStrategy Becomes One of the Largest Winners in the Bitcoin and Crypto Bull Market MicroStrategy Inc., a prominent name in enterprise software and a key player in the cryptocurrency market, has seen a significant surge in the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Recently, Bitcoin's price has surpassed $47,000, a notable increase that has directly impacted MicroStrategy's investment portfolio. As of 9 Jan, 2024, MicroStrategy holds approximately 189,150 Bitcoins, nearly 1% of the total Bitcoins in circulation. The average cost of these acquisitions stands at $31,168 per Bitcoin, totaling around $5.895 billion. With Bitcoin's price exceeding $47,000, the total market value of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin assets has reached about $8.89 billion, translating into a gain of around $3 billion. Founded in 1989, MicroStrategy has transitioned from its roots in database and business intelligence software to becoming a key player in the digital asset space. MicroStrategy's journey in the Bitcoin landscape began in the summer of 2020 under the leadership of founder Michael Saylor, with a strategy focused on accumulating Bitcoin. This approach positioned the company as the largest Bitcoin holder among public companies. MicroStrategy made its first foray into the Bitcoin market on August 11, 2020. The company invested a substantial $250 million of its inflation-hedging funds into purchasing 21,454 Bitcoins. This initial investment, made at an average price of $11,882 per Bitcoin, marked a pivotal moment in MicroStrategy's approach to treasury management, reflecting its confidence in Bitcoin as a superior asset class compared to traditional cash holdings. However, the journey wasn't without its challenges. Following the 2021 bull run, Bitcoin and other crypto assets experienced a significant price drop. In December 2022, amidst the market volatility following the FTX bankruptcy announcement, MicroStrategy sold 704 Bitcoins at an average price of $16,761. This strategic sale, a departure from its initial \"buy and hold\" strategy, was made for tax purposes and aimed to generate tax benefits by offsetting capital losses against previous gains. There were also rumors about MicroStrategy's potential bankruptcy, partly because a significant portion of the funds used for Bitcoin purchases were sourced through corporate loans. The latest investment into bitcoin was made between November 30 and December 26, 2023. During this period, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries purchased approximately 14,620 Bitcoins at an average price of roughly $42,110, amounting to a total investment of about $615.7 million.

November 30, 2023: Purchased 16,130 BTC at an average price of about $36,785 Conclusion MicroStrategy's strategic investment in Bitcoin has led to substantial returns, particularly highlighted by the recent surge in Bitcoin's value. This strategy has not only been beneficial for MicroStrategy but also served as a catalyst for other companies to consider incorporating digital assets into their investment portfolios. Moreover, the broader market is observing developments like the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF with keen interest. Such advancements, if realized, could further enhance the acceptance and integration of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in mainstream financial strategies, indicating a significant shift in the investment landscape.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-09",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Mercari, Japan's leading e-commerce platform, has announced its plan to introduce Bitcoin as a payment option. This move is set to take effect in June 2024, marking a pivotal moment in the integration of digital currencies into mainstream commerce. Founded in 2013, Mercari has rapidly grown to become a major player in Japan's e-commerce landscape. With a user base exceeding 22 million per month, the platform's decision to embrace Bitcoin payments reflects a strategic alignment with the evolving digital economy. The implementation of Bitcoin transactions on Mercari will be facilitated by Melcoin, a Tokyo-based subsidiary of the company specializing in cryptocurrency services. This approach demonstrates Mercari's commitment to leveraging its internal resources and expertise in the digital currency domain. Interestingly, while Mercari will allow transactions in Bitcoin, product pricing on the platform will remain in Japanese yen. This dual-currency approach balances the innovation of cryptocurrency payments with the stability and familiarity of traditional fiat currency, catering to a broad spectrum of consumer preferences. The move by Mercari is not just a standalone decision but is part of a broader context of Japan's progressive stance on cryptocurrencies. The country has been at the forefront of crypto regulation, with the Payment Services Act recognizing Bitcoin and other virtual assets as legitimate property since April 2017. This proactive regulatory approach has fostered an environment conducive to the adoption and integration of digital currencies in various sectors. Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. Regularly reviewing and updating regulations, the FSA strives to balance the promotion of innovation with the need for financial stability. Recent relaxations in the screening process for tokens and further easing of regulations by March 2024 illustrate the country's commitment to creating a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, Mercari's adoption of Bitcoin payments signifies a significant milestone in the convergence of e-commerce and digital currencies. It reflects a growing trend where major platforms are increasingly recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies. This move by Mercari, backed by Japan's supportive regulatory framework, could pave the way for more widespread adoption of digital currencies in e-commerce globally. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "An event unfolded in the Bitcoin blockchain on January 6, 2024, capturing the attention of the crypto community. An unidentified individual executed a series of 332 transactions, spending approximately 1.5 BTC, equaling around $66,000, to inscribe nearly 9 megabytes of raw binary data on the blockchain. These inscriptions, carried out around 11:20 am UTC, have been a source of intrigue and speculation since their discovery. What makes these inscriptions so fascinating is their cryptic nature. The data, composed of raw binary, remains undecipherable, sparking widespread curiosity and numerous theories within the crypto community. Some suggest the data might be encrypted, rendering it almost impossible or extremely challenging to decrypt. This theory was posited by Leonidas, the host of The Ordinal Show, reflecting the mystery surrounding the inscriptions. The Bitcoin address involved, labeled simply as \u201CUnnamed\u201D on Ord.io, has added to the enigma. The encrypted data features a mix of English, Greek, and mathematical symbols, further complicating any attempts at interpretation. Notably, two of the 332 inscriptions are distinguished by a digital pepperoni pizza symbol. This symbol indicates that these inscriptions contain satoshis from the 10,000 BTC used in the famous purchase of two Papa John's pepperoni pizzas by early Bitcoin contributor Laszlo Hanyecz in 2010. This historical reference adds an additional layer of interest to the mystery. The Ord.io protocol, used for these inscriptions, allows the association of data with specific satoshis, the smallest Bitcoin unit. Ordinarily used for storing artwork directly on the blockchain, the protocol is flexible enough to inscribe any form of data, including encrypted text. The utilization of this protocol for such a cryptic purpose has left many pondering the intentions behind these actions. In a broader context, this event is not the only intriguing occurrence in the Bitcoin ecosystem recently. Just a day before, on January 5, an anonymous wallet transferred a staggering 26.9 BTC, worth approximately $1.17 million, to Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis wallet, the first-ever created Bitcoin wallet. The wallet, associated with Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has been inactive since 2010, making this transaction particularly baffling and adding to the air of mystery in the crypto world.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In a landmark decision, Próspera ZEDE, a special economic zone in Roatán, Honduras, has officially adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as a unit of account. This significant move, announced on January 5, 2024, by Jorge Colindres, the acting manager and Tax Commissioner of Próspera ZEDE, marks a substantial step forward in the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial systems. Less than two years after declaring Bitcoin as legal tender, this latest development allows legal entities within the zone to use Bitcoin for measuring the market value of goods and services. It symbolizes a shift towards greater financial freedom for individuals and businesses, offering them the liberty to carry out transactions, perform accounting, and report taxes in their chosen currency. However, this transition isn't without its complexities. Initially, tax liabilities for entities choosing Bitcoin will be calculated in reference to BTC but reported in United States dollars or Honduran Lempiras. This interim measure is due to technological constraints in Próspera's eGovernance system and external regulatory challenges. The ultimate goal, as stated by Colindres, is to implement a \"Final BTC Tax Payment Procedure,\" enabling entities to report and pay tax liabilities directly in Bitcoin once the existing issues are resolved. Entities interested in adopting Bitcoin as their unit of account must formally notify the Próspera tax commission within 30 days of the relevant tax period, referencing an approved cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase or Kraken for this purpose. Próspera ZEDE, established in May 2020 on Roatán's northern island, has been a trailblazer in integrating cryptocurrency within its economic structure. The adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in April 2022, followed by this recent recognition of Bitcoin as a unit of account, positions Próspera as a pioneering force in the crypto realm. Furthermore, Próspera's advancements have not only been limited to cryptocurrency adoption but have also spurred significant economic growth. Over its three-year operation, the zone has reportedly attracted over $100 million in investments and created more than 3,000 jobs, underlining its role as a competitive regime in Latin America.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance.US, the American subsidiary of the global cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has recently announced the appointment of Lesley O\u2019Neill as its new Chief Compliance Officer. This move is particularly significant as it occurs in the context of increased regulatory scrutiny from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lesley O\u2019Neill brings a wealth of experience to Binance.US, with nearly 15 years of expertise in regulatory and privacy compliance, information security, and identity verification and authentication. Her career spans multiple high-profile positions, including her role as Chief Compliance Officer at Prove Identity, Inc., and Global Privacy Counsel at Ernst & Young. O\u2019Neill's extensive background in legal and compliance roles is a vital asset to Binance.US, especially in light of recent challenges faced by the company. In June, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance for allegedly conducting unregistered sales of crypto asset securities and mishandling customer funds. Amidst these legal issues, O\u2019Neill\u2019s role at Binance.US will involve leading initiatives in critical areas such as sanctions, anti-money laundering, and know-your-customer (KYC) efforts. Her appointment reflects Binance.US's commitment to enhancing its compliance framework and adhering to regulatory standards. The broader cryptocurrency industry is witnessing a significant shift towards compliance and regulatory adherence. This is evident from recent legal developments involving Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, who faced a substantial settlement with the US Department of Justice, with Zhao awaiting a sentencing hearing. The SEC continues to pursue allegations against Binance and Zhao for deliberate violations of US securities laws. The industry is also experiencing a surge in demand for compliance and technical talent. The appointment of seasoned professionals like O\u2019Neill and similar strategic hires across the industry underscore a concerted effort to navigate the complex and evolving regulatory landscape. These appointments reflect a strategic pivot towards enhanced compliance, regulatory engagement, and transparency within the crypto industry, aiming to build trust among customers and regulators.

Exchanges must comply with stringent risk assessments and finance tests, impacting both domestic and offshore entities.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United Kingdom's cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing significant changes as it aligns with the Financial Services and Markets Act. This pivotal development, marking a substantial shift in regulatory approach, aims to apply rigorous standards, akin to those in traditional financial services, to firms operating with cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Gemini have already initiated measures in response to these new regulations. They have introduced risk assessments and finance tests for users in the UK, which include a declaration about their investor profile and a related questionnaire. These steps are critical for compliance with the requirements that demand crypto companies to inform users about the risks associated with trading cryptocurrencies and advertise their services responsibly. Notably, the failure to complete these measures will prevent users from trading with their crypto accounts. The broader framework for these regulatory changes is set out by the UK Government, intending to balance innovation with financial stability and clear regulatory standards. New specific regulated activities for cryptoassets will be created, paralleling those in traditional financial markets. Consequently, crypto native firms, whose primary business revolves around cryptoassets, will need full authorization and supervision by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Traditional finance firms will also have the opportunity to expand their permissions to include cryptoasset activities. In addition to the direct impact on firms operating within the UK, these regulations extend their reach to offshore firms providing services to UK clients. These firms will need authorization in the UK, although exceptions like 'reverse solicitation' are under consideration. This new regulatory environment encompasses a range of activities including trading, custody, and lending, each with specific requirements. For instance, trading venues must offer fair access rules, transparent fee schedules, and effective conflict of interest management. Cryptoasset intermediation will be regulated akin to the rules for investment firms, emphasizing consumer protection and market abuse detection. The HM Treasury is also exploring the regulation of decentralized finance (DeFi) and seeking to understand how regulatory outcomes achieved in traditional finance can be applied to DeFi. This includes consideration for cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, and how these services align with current regulatory practices. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "For the first time in a decade, there was a notable decrease in the number of Bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide. As of January 1, 2024, Coin ATM Radar reported a reduction to 33,628 ATMs, down from 37,827 on January 1, 2023, representing an 11.1% decrease. This trend reversed a steady growth observed since Coin ATM Radar began tracking crypto ATMs in October 2013. August 2022 witnessed the peak with 39,376 ATMs globally. However, the most significant decline occurred in the United States, which saw a 15.4% reduction in its ATM count. Despite this, the U.S. still hosts 82% of the world's crypto ATMs. The decline can be partly attributed to the performance of specific manufacturers. BitAccess, a key ATM manufacturer, saw a 26% decrease in its net installations, dropping from 9,160 in August 2022 to 6,774 by January 2024. In contrast, manufacturers like General Bytes and Genesis Coin continued to grow their Bitcoin ATM installations throughout the year. Notably, Bitcoin Depot, a leading player in the crypto ATM space, expanded to its 28th U.S. state and reported a 3% year-on-year revenue increase in Q3 2023, despite fluctuations in Bitcoin's price. This growth indicates continued demand for cryptocurrency ATMs in specific markets. While the global and U.S. numbers declined, the trend in the European Union was positive. The EU saw a slight increase, with the number of crypto ATMs rising from 1,538 at the beginning of 2023 to 1,548 in 2024. Other countries like Canada, Australia, Spain, and Poland also experienced growth in their Bitcoin ATM installations, highlighting a more diverse and region-specific adoption pattern. The use of Bitcoin ATMs, often crucial for the underbanked or unbanked, has been rising due to their ease of access. Despite higher fees compared to online crypto exchanges, BTMs offer immediate conversion of physical cash to digital currency, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions, cross-border payments, and familial monetary support. This convenience continues to drive their popularity among a certain segment of users. However, the industry faces challenges, including scams, money laundering, and regulatory compliance. The market is undergoing consolidation as larger companies acquire smaller operators, partly due to the difficulties in maintaining regulatory compliance. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Investment management firms, stock exchanges, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been in final discussions regarding the approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), a long-awaited development in the crypto industry. Recently, the SEC engaged in meetings to finalize wording changes on filings for these ETFs, a critical step that could lead to the first-ever U.S. approval of the funds. The focus has been on the S-1 prospectus documents necessary for every ETF, with issuers anticipating final approval by late Tuesday or Wednesday of the next week. Notably, the SEC sought minor amendments in some applications, such as fee disclosures or identities of market-makers for the ETFs. These updates were due on a Monday, with public disclosure expected on the same day. This move indicates the SEC's commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Additionally, the SEC's involvement in finalizing 19b-4 filings, outlining rule changes necessary for launching spot Bitcoin ETFs, demonstrates its proactive approach in shaping the cryptocurrency investment landscape. The crypto community has been eagerly anticipating the SEC's decision, with industry analysts estimating a 98% chance of approval. This optimism stems from the SEC's active engagement with potential issuers during the busy holiday season, aiming to streamline the final details and structure the creation and redemption procedure of these ETFs. BlackRock, one of the leading financial services firms, recently filed its fourth amendment to its application, preparing to seed its Bitcoin ETF with $10 million. However, there are complexities associated with the launch of such ETFs. The SEC has requested that issuers have their authorized participant agreement ready, which describes the role of creating and redeeming ETF shares. This role requires a deep understanding of digital assets and the capability to provide safekeeping, custody, and compliance with various regulatory requirements. The challenge is amplified given that not many traditional brokerages are equipped to handle these responsibilities. Investor sentiment has been influenced by the impending decision, causing price volatility for Bitcoin and related ETFs. This fluctuation reflects a mix of profit-taking after substantial gains in 2023 and investor uncertainty regarding the SEC's decision. Analysts predict that Bitcoin's price could surge upon SEC approval, but a rejection could lead to a significant drop, as issuers might be asked to meet more stringent requirements. In parallel, other regions, like Hong Kong, are making strides in the realm of spot Bitcoin ETFs, albeit following a more conventional regulatory approach. The Hong Kong Securities & Futures Commission has been methodically progressing, first issuing virtual asset management licenses and then virtual asset exchange licenses. This step-by-step approach contrasts with the more dynamic and uncertain regulatory landscape in the U.S.. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The world of cryptocurrency is abuzz with speculations and predictions, especially concerning Bitcoin's future value. A recent forecast by Matrixport, a prominent crypto financial services firm, has particularly garnered attention. They project that Bitcoin (BTC) could potentially reach a staggering $125,000 by the end of 2024, following its fourth halving event. Understanding the Halving Phenomenon To comprehend the basis of this prediction, one must understand the concept of Bitcoin halving. It is a built-in feature of Bitcoin that halves the reward for mining new blocks, thereby reducing the rate at which new bitcoins are generated. This event occurs approximately every four years and is seen as a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency. It essentially decreases the supply of new bitcoins, which, according to traditional economic theory, could lead to an increase in price if demand remains constant or increases. Historical Trends and Predictions Historically, Bitcoin has shown a tendency to increase in value in the period leading up to a halving event. However, there is no consistent trend immediately after the halving. Despite these short-term uncertainties, Bitcoin has recorded a new all-time high in each four-year period between halvings, suggesting a positive long-term performance. CoinCodex, another source delving into Bitcoin price predictions, supports this optimistic view. They forecast a nearly +50% increase in Bitcoin's price one month after the April 2024 halving, reaching approximately $70,200. This rally is expected to continue over the year, potentially leading to a new all-time high at around $175,000. Looking even further ahead, their algorithm suggests a peak above $170,000 in August 2025, before stabilizing in the $95,000-$100,000 range. Matrixport's Bold Prediction Matrixport's bold prediction of $125,000 hinges on the historical impact of halving events on Bitcoin's price and the general market anticipation of these events. Given the cyclical nature of Bitcoin's price movements around halving events and the long-term trend of reaching new all-time highs post-halving, their forecast aligns with the broader expectation of a significant price rally.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Solana blockchain project, Mangofarm, gets embroiled in a controversy reminiscent of the notorious Banana Miner Ponzi scheme. This development throws a spotlight on the perennial challenges of trust and security in the digital currency domain. Mangofarm, a project within the Solana blockchain, is now under scrutiny due to its suspected links to the infamous Banana Miner Ponzi scheme. Investigations reveal that coded messages embedded in Mangofarm\u2019s programming bear a sinister resemblance to those associated with the Banana Miner fiasco. Initially misinterpreted as distress signals, these messages are now seen as taunts from a scammer who seems to be mocking his victims. Users on the X platform raised the alarm about Mangofarm, reporting unauthorized withdrawals from wallets interacting with the project. This pattern, closely mirroring classic scam tactics, heightened concerns within the crypto community. The Solana community, in response, has been advised to exercise extreme caution, particularly those involved with Mangofarm or related projects. Current recommendations include transferring assets to more secure wallets and revoking any approvals linked to Mangofarm. The Banana Miner Ponzi scheme, allegedly masterminded by British national Richard Matthew John O\u2019Neill (aka Jo Cook), defrauded investors of a staggering $6.5 million in bitcoin. The scheme, described in a U.S. forfeiture suit, involved false promises of refunds and a pivot to a laundering and refund scheme. Despite promising transparency and a level playing field for users, O\u2019Neill's operation led to significant losses for investors, with some losing substantial amounts of bitcoin. The scheme collapsed soon after the late-2017 bitcoin price surge, leaving many investors in financial distress. as a stark reminder of the volatile and often perilous nature of investments in the cryptocurrency sphere. The case of Mangofarm's alleged connection to the Banana Miner scheme underscores the importance of due diligence and cautious scrutiny by investors in the digital currency world. It also highlights the sophisticated methods used by scammers to exploit the decentralized and often unregulated nature of cryptocurrency platforms. The Mangofarm situation has prompted a community-wide call for increased security measures and awareness. Users are being urged to remain vigilant about where and how they invest their digital assets. The cryptocurrency community is once again reminded that while blockchain and digital currencies offer revolutionary potential, they are not immune to the age-old risks of fraud and deception.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The world's biggest asset management, BlackRock Inc., is now making news for two significant innovations that are a reflection of the strategic modifications it has made in response to the ever-changing financial environment. BlackRock has just made the announcement that it would be significantly reducing its personnel. roughly three percent of its workforce throughout the globe, which amounts to roughly 600 people, would be impacted by this relocation. This move is reminiscent of a similar step that was made in 2023, which suggests that there will be a trend of yearly modifications to the staff depending on performance. The company has already reduced the number of workers by 500 earlier this year, so this is the second wave of layoffs that they have implemented this year. As part of BlackRock's larger plan to navigate through the present market issues, the company has decided to lay off employees. This decision reflects the company's proactive effort to retaining its competitive advantage. These choices will have a significant impact on the company's finances, including the imposition of a restructuring charge of $91 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. This charge will largely cover severance and pay adjustments for workers who will be impacted by the decision. BlackRock is presently at the forefront of a substantial development in the bitcoin industry, which is taking place simultaneously. Currently, the company is waiting for the decision that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will make on its application for a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). It is predicted that this decision will be made by January 10, 2024, and the cryptocurrency world is eagerly anticipating it. As indicated by the latest update filing that BlackRock made with the Nasdaq for its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal, BlackRock has been increasing the intensity of its attempts to match with SEC requirements. In addition, the corporation has taken the initiative to seed its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with ten million dollars in cash, demonstrating its faith in a positive conclusion. The SEC has only allowed cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are related to futures contracts up to this point, so the approval of this ETF would be a significant step forward. It is anticipated that this event will have substantial repercussions for the cryptocurrency market, which may result in the opening of new doors for both institutional and individual investors alike.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "To expand its global influence, Coinbase, a major US cryptocurrency exchange, has announced plans to enter the European Union derivatives market. The year 2024 marks a strategic turn for Coinbase as it aims to acquire a Cyprus-based entity licensed under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014 (MiFID II). This significant move will enable Coinbase to offer regulated derivatives, including futures and options, within the EU, enhancing its service portfolio and market reach. The Strategic Acquisition in Cyprus Coinbase's decision to acquire a MiFID-licensed entity in Cyprus is pending regulatory approval. Once finalized, this acquisition will significantly bolster Coinbase's presence in the European market. This strategic move is aligned with Coinbase's 2024 objectives, indicating a focused expansion into the European derivatives market, a sector experiencing rapid growth and increasing demand for regulated crypto-based financial products. Understanding MiFID II and its Implications MiFID II represents the EU\u2019s updated regulations governing financial instruments. It plays a pivotal role in this expansion, as it allows entities to offer regulated trading services across EU member states. By leveraging this license, Coinbase plans to offer a range of derivatives products, a notable extension from its current offerings of spot trading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Impact on the European Derivatives Market The entry of Coinbase into the EU derivatives market is set to create waves, offering more choices to traders and investors in the region. It signifies the growing integration of cryptocurrency products into mainstream financial markets and reflects the evolving regulatory landscape in the EU. Coinbase's ability to offer regulated derivatives is expected to attract a diverse group of investors, enhancing liquidity and stability in the crypto market. Anticipating Regulatory Approval and Future Prospects The acquisition, contingent on regulatory approval, is anticipated to be finalized in 2024. Coinbase's expansion into the European derivatives market is a testament to its commitment to compliance, innovation, and customer service. This move is not only about business growth but also about adapting to the changing demands of the global financial ecosystem. Coinbase's expansion is seen as a proactive step in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion Coinbase's planned expansion into the EU derivatives market through the acquisition of a MiFID II licensed entity in Cyprus marks a significant milestone in the company\u2019s growth strategy. This move is set to enhance Coinbase's service offerings and solidify its position as a leading player in the global cryptocurrency market. As the company awaits regulatory approval, the cryptocurrency and financial sectors eagerly anticipate the impact of this expansion on the European and global markets. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "DCG Resolves Debts Amid Turbulence in the Crypto Sector The Digital Currency Group (DCG), a key player in the cryptocurrency sector, has accomplished a big milestone by paying off all of its short-term loans to Genesis, a bitcoin lending platform that has since been dissolved. In the continuous tale of bitcoin business issues and attempts to restructure, this signals a significant milestone that is of critical importance. The Beginning of the Process of Dissolution, Beginning with Suspension During the month of November 2022, Genesis, which had previously been a prominent bitcoin lending platform, had a significant setback when it ceased withdrawals. The turbulent circumstances in the cryptocurrency market were the driving force behind this decision, which ultimately resulted in Genesis declaring for bankruptcy in January of 2023. In the months leading up to its bankruptcy, Genesis was struggling under the weight of significant debts, with its top fifty creditors owing more than $3.5 billion alone. Strategy for Commitment and Repayment Employed by DCG A promise was made by DCG in November 2023 to settle all outstanding commitments to Genesis by April 2024. This pledge was made in the midst of very difficult circumstances. Barry Silbert, the Chief Executive Officer of DCG, said that the company was able to successfully fulfill these loan commitments despite the challenging environment that prevailed in the cryptocurrency market for the whole year of 2023. Recent confirmations from DCG have shown that Genesis has received funds in the amount of around 700 million dollars. The greater sum of more than one billion dollars that was delivered to creditors throughout the course of the previous year includes this amount as a component. DCG's efforts to stabilize its business and stick to its promises in a market that is volatile are shown by this hefty payment. Repercussions and Prospects for the Future The continuing reorganization and realignment that is taking place inside the cryptocurrency industry is brought to light by the breakup of Genesis and the repayment by DCG for their debt. The problems that bitcoin firms have in managing market swings and ensuring financial stability are brought into sharper focus by these occurrences. In addition, the successful settlement reached by DCG may serve as a model for other organizations who find themselves in a scenario like to their own, providing a look into possible recovery paths in the unpredictable cryptocurrency market.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In 2023, the cryptocurrency world was shaken by a startling revelation from TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence firm. The report indicated that groups linked to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) were responsible for approximately 33% of all cryptocurrency thefts during the year, potentially amassing up to $700 million through these illicit activities. The gravity of this situation is highlighted by the fact that nearly $1.5 billion was stolen by DPRK in the previous two years, marking a significant and worrying trend in cyber theft. This alarming increase in cyber thefts by North Korean operatives demonstrates their growing proficiency in this illicit domain. The Methods of DPRK\u2019s Crypto Heists The tactics employed by DPRK in these heists have evolved over time, showcasing a sophisticated understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. In 2023, major thefts involving platforms such as Atomic Wallet, Alphapo, and CoinsPaid were attributed to North Korean operatives, causing a loss of approximately $197 million in cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, one of their favored methods included the use of crypto mixers like Tornado Cash. However, following sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash in August 2023 by the US Department of Justice, DPRK hackers explored alternative methods for their operations. This adaptation to changing circumstances underlines the resilience and cunning of these cybercriminals in circumventing security measures. The Crypto Conversion Strategy A crucial aspect of these thefts involved converting the stolen assets to cryptocurrencies like Tether or Tron, although specific details on this conversion process in 2023 are not explicitly mentioned in available sources. This strategy likely served the dual purpose of laundering the stolen funds and evading detection by law enforcement agencies. The use of such cryptocurrencies, known for their stability and widespread acceptance, might have facilitated the seamless integration of these illicit funds into the global crypto economy. The Ongoing Threat Despite international sanctions and vigilance, North Korea remains a significant cyber threat, with their tactics continuously evolving to evade law enforcement. This persistence poses a continuous challenge to the global community, especially in the realm of cybersecurity and financial regulation. In conclusion, the events of 2023 serve as a stark reminder of the ever-present danger posed by state-sponsored cybercriminals, especially those backed by regimes like DPRK. The crypto community, regulators, and international bodies must remain vigilant and collaborate to counter these sophisticated threats. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On a day closely following the 15th anniversary of Bitcoin's Genesis Block, an event that turned heads in the cryptocurrency world unfolded. An unknown market participant transferred 26.91 BTC, valued at approximately $1.17 million, to a wallet address believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's enigmatic creator. This transaction has sparked intense speculation and discussion within the crypto community, raising questions about its implications and the motivations behind it. Historical Context and Significance of the Genesis Block To understand the magnitude of this event, it's essential to revisit the inception of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, known as the Genesis Block, in 2009, laying the foundation for what would become a transformative technology. The Genesis Block is significant not just as a technical achievement but also as a symbolic act. Nakamoto embedded in it a message reflecting the economic turmoil of the time, hinting at skepticism towards the traditional financial system. The Genesis Block's distinct characteristics, like the unspendable initial 50 BTC and the unique message it contained, have made it a subject of fascination and reverence in the crypto community. It symbolizes Bitcoin's potential to challenge conventional financial structures and has inspired a commitment to decentralization and peer-to-peer transactions. Speculations Around the Recent Transaction The recent transaction to Nakamoto's wallet address has reignited discussions about Nakamoto's identity and intentions. Some in the crypto community view this as a tribute to Bitcoin's creator, echoing the sentiment of sending bitcoins to the original, unspendable Genesis Block address. Others speculate whether the real Satoshi Nakamoto might be signaling their presence or involvement in the current Bitcoin network. This event also coincides with significant developments and upgrades in Bitcoin's technology since the Genesis Block, showcasing the evolution of the network from its initial design. Innovations like smart contract functionality, increased block size, and the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals mark the continuous growth and adaptation of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-05",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Both the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) have begun an important inquiry into the complex ties that exist between conventional banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which includes the cryptocurrency industry, which is undergoing fast development. A significant worry has been raised over the possible systemic hazards that might arise from these linkages, particularly in high-pressure financial conditions. This action highlights this increasing concern. Nearly half of the world's financial assets, which are estimated to be worth $219 trillion, are now held by non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which include hedge funds, private equity companies, money market funds, and crypto businesses. New dynamics have been brought into the financial ecosystem as a result of this rapidly expanding industry, which simultaneously offers advantages related to diversification while also bringing new problems. The proliferation of digital currencies in particular has attracted the attention of investors as well as the scrutiny of regulatory authorities. By means of its recently implemented Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law, the European Union is making an effort to bring the crypto framework of its member states into conformity with one another. The European Banking Authority (EBA), which is in charge of performing stress tests on EU banks every two years, is putting more and more of its attention on the possible contagion effects that may be caused by non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). The Chair of the European Banking Authority, José Manuel Campa, underlined the need of an understanding of the \"whole underlying chain in NBFIs\" in order to evaluate the effects that a shock to shadow banking might have on the larger financial system. In accordance with this, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has suggested regulations for cryptocurrency enterprises to guarantee thorough due diligence and transaction monitoring, as well as drafted guidelines that target liquidity and capital requirements for stablecoin issuers. The European Bank for Economic Cooperation (EBA) and the European Securities and Exchange Board (ESRB) are working together to analyze the intricate web of relationships that exist between banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). The effort was conceived out of worries over the potential for stress within the non-bank financial institution (NBFI) sector, which includes crypto businesses, hedge funds, and private capital groups, to spread to the banking sector, which may possibly lead to greater systemic difficulties. Campa brought attention to the fact that while the direct connections between banks and non-banks have been evaluated, the mechanisms of indirect transmission continue to be an equally important topic of research. The probe is a component of a larger worldwide effort to regulate the shadow banking industry and reduce the risks to the stability of the financial system. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a motion on January 3, 2023, in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. This filing highlighted parallels between its case against Terraform Labs, its co-founder Do Kwon, and its enforcement action against Binance, Binance.US, and Changpeng Zhao, Binance's former CEO. The SEC's filing drew attention to a December 28 ruling against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon by Judge Jed Rakoff. In this ruling, Judge Rakoff sided with the SEC, determining that specific tokens involved in the alleged Terraform fraud were securities. This was based on the fact that they are investment contracts and the offers and sales of UST constituted an investment contract. The SEC emphasized the relevance of Judge Rakoff's analysis of Terraform's 'stablecoin' UST to its case against Binance's 'stablecoin' BUSD, and Binance's staking-as-a-service, BNB Vault, and Simple Earn programs. This connection was highlighted in the January 3 filing, suggesting that the Terraform Labs judgment could provide \"further grounds\" for Judge Amy Jackson to consider denying a motion to dismiss from Binance. The charges against Binance and Zhao include operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies; misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform; and the unregistered offer and sale of securities. The SEC alleges that while Zhao and Binance claimed that US customers were restricted from transacting on Binance.com, in reality, high-value US customers continued trading on the platform. Furthermore, Binance.US was purportedly independent but was allegedly secretly controlled by Zhao and Binance. SEC Chair Gary Gensler accused Zhao and Binance of engaging in an \"extensive web of deception,\" involving conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and evasion of the law. The SEC's complaint alleges that since at least July 2017, Binance.com and Binance.US, under Zhao's control, operated as exchanges, brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, generating at least $11.6 billion in revenue from US customers. The SEC also charged Binance for the unregistered offers and sales of BNB, BUSD, and crypto-lending products, as well as BAM Trading with the unregistered offer and sale of Binance.US\u2019 staking-as-a-service program. The complaint noted that Binance secretly controls assets staked by US customers in BAM\u2019s staking program. The Terraform Labs and Binance cases are part of a series of SEC enforcement actions in 2023 alleging platforms offered unregistered securities. These actions also involve lawsuits against Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, and others, indicating a broader regulatory focus on the cryptocurrency sector. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-05",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Cipher Mining Technologies Inc. has announced the purchase of 16,700 new Bitcoin miners. This significant acquisition is aligned with the company's strategy to become a leading industry player in light of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected in April 2024. Understanding Bitcoin Halving and Its Impact The halving of Bitcoin is a basic function in the Bitcoin network. It is a pre-programmed occurrence that takes place about every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks that are mined. In this method, the mining incentives are cut in half, which has the effect of lowering the pace at which new Bitcoins are created and, as a result, regulating the supply of Bitcoin. This mechanism, which has a direct impact on the scarcity of Bitcoin, has traditionally been responsible for driving up the value of the cryptocurrency. In April of 2024, there will be a halving, and it is anticipated that this would produce similar market dynamics. Historical data from past halving occurrences in 2012, 2016, and 2020 reveals a trend of price rises after these occasions. This pattern is caused by the decreased supply and increasing speculative interest in the cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, it is essential to keep in mind that the performance of the past does not necessarily serve as a predictor of the outcomes of the future. Cipher Mining's Strategy: Timing and Execution Cipher Mining's CEO, Tyler Page, emphasized that the timing of this purchase is strategically aligned with the Bitcoin halving event. The company anticipates that the reduction in mining rewards will lead to an outsized price increase for Bitcoin, as observed in past halving cycles. The new miners, the latest generation Avalon A1466 models, will be installed at Cipher's Bear and Chief Mountain facilities in Texas, effectively increasing the firm's self-mining capacity to 8.4 exahashes per second (EH\/s). The terms of the purchase, made with Canaan, were not disclosed, but Cipher described them as \"very favorable\". Cipher's recent acquisition is not its first significant investment in mining hardware. In the previous year, the company purchased 37,396 Antminer T21 miners from Bitmain for a total of $99.5 million, which will contribute 7.1 EH\/s to their mining capacity. However, these miners are scheduled for delivery in the first half of 2025. Future Predictions and Market Speculations Looking forward, market analysts and industry experts have varied predictions about the 2024 halving's impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price and market dynamics. Some anticipate a continuation of historical trends, with a surge in Bitcoin's price post-halving. Others caution against overly optimistic expectations due to the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and increasing institutional interest, which could lead to more subdued price movements. Cipher Mining's recent purchase is a calculated bet on the future of Bitcoin, reflecting a broader industry sentiment that values strategic timing and foresight. As the halving event nears, the entire cryptocurrency market is likely to witness heightened activity and volatility, providing both challenges and opportunities for companies like Cipher Mining.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-04",
        "detailedArticleContent": "At the beginning of January 2023, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea made several decisions that were quite important. A legislative notice that was published on January 3 brought to light the worries of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) over the possibility of money laundering and illegal financial outflows that are associated with South Koreans acquiring cryptocurrencies from foreign exchanges. As a result of these issues, a change to the Enforcement Decree of the Credit-Specialized Financial Business Act has been proposed as a potential solution. The major objective of this amendment is to prohibit the use of credit cards for the purchase of cryptocurrencies, with a particular emphasis on transactions that take place on international exchanges. The implementation of this action is a component of a more comprehensive plan to strengthen rules in the bitcoin industry. In addition, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has recommended a modification to the Credit Finance Act, which would essentially bar individuals of South Korea from purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards when they make purchases. In line with the government's larger initiatives to regulate the cryptocurrency business in a more severe manner, this endeavor is being undertaken. Late in the month of January 2023, the Ministry of Justice made the announcement that they will be developing a \"Virtual Currency Tracking System,\" prioritizing the development of this system. It is the intention of this system to put a stop to operations that involve money laundering and are made possible by cryptocurrency. South Korea's approach to the regulation of cryptocurrencies will undergo a substantial transformation in the year 2023. Act on the Protection of Virtual Asset Users was just passed, as was recently stated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). With regard to the cryptocurrency sector, this Act places an emphasis on user safety, transaction transparency, and market discipline with regard to the industry. In addition, new and comprehensive cryptocurrency law is going to be introduced in South Korea by the year 2024, with the goal of further institutionalizing the cryptocurrency industry. From the month of April 2023 forward, it is anticipated that the South Korean parliament will enact a measure that would govern the market for digital assets. This new development follows the introduction of 18 laws pertaining to digital assets, which are presently being discussed in the Political Affairs Committee of the National Assembly of South Korea.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-04",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The cryptocurrency exchange OKX is set to align with traditional finance standards in the United Kingdom by introducing mandatory risk-awareness questionnaires for its UK users starting January 8, 2024. This move comes as a direct response to the new regulations implemented by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), reflecting a growing trend towards integrating more stringent measures in the cryptocurrency sector to promote responsible trading and informed decision-making. The New Regulatory Landscape The FCA's recent regulations, designed to enhance industry oversight and promote responsible trading, are significantly reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape in the UK. These rules require crypto firms to register with the financial regulator and ensure that their marketing materials are approved by an FCA-authorized firm. The new regulations emphasize the necessity for clear warnings about the risks associated with crypto investments, ensuring that marketing materials are fair, transparent, and non-misleading, and instituting a 24-hour cooling-off period for new customers. OKX's Compliance Efforts In compliance with these FCA regulations, OKX announced significant changes to its user experience for both new and existing retail users in the UK. The key component of these changes is the introduction of two specific questionnaires. The first one, a client categorization questionnaire, aims to classify the investor profile of the user and confirm their understanding of the risks involved. The second, an appropriateness assessment, is designed to evaluate the user's knowledge about investing in crypto assets. These assessments are crucial in determining whether users are eligible to trade on the OKX platform. Failing to complete these questionnaires or demonstrating insufficient understanding of the risks will result in users being ineligible to maintain an OKX account. Implications for UK Users The introduction of these questionnaires signifies a notable shift in the way cryptocurrency trading is approached in the UK. It aligns with traditional finance standards, emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making and understanding of the risks involved in crypto trading. This approach is reflected in OKX's tagline, \"Trade responsibly,\" which underscores their commitment to educating customers about responsible trading practices. Broader Industry Impact The FCA's stringent stance has spurred compliance efforts across the cryptocurrency industry. Notable exchanges like Binance and OKX are adjusting their operations to meet these new regulatory requirements. This change reflects a broader movement within the cryptocurrency sector towards adopting more conventional financial norms and practices, which could potentially lead to a more stable and reliable digital asset market.

This piece of legislation is a component of a larger initiative to close the tax deficit in the United States, with a particular focus on the quickly development of the digital asset market. Source: Twitter One of the most important provisions of the law is the modification of Section 6050I, which extends the definition of \"cash\" to include digital assets. As a consequence of this, commencing in the year 2024, every person or company that gets more than $10,000 in digital assets as a result of their commercial or business activity will be required to submit Form 8300 reports to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

One of the most important aspects of this piece of legislation is the mandate that requires full reporting of transactions involving digital assets that exceed $10,000. A considerable obligation is placed on cryptocurrency brokers as a result of this provision, which originates directly from the infrastructure law that was passed by both parties. They are now obligated to provide the Internal Revenue Service with detailed information on transactions of this kind. This comprises the personal information of consumers who are engaged in transactions that are more than $10,000, such as their names, addresses, and social security numbers. This information is required to be disclosed within fifteen days after the transaction. It is clear that the government is placing a greater emphasis on the cryptocurrency market, as seen by the proposed rules that were released by the Biden administration about the implementation of this essential revenue-raising component of the 2021 infrastructure bill. The purpose of these laws is to improve compliance and decrease tax evasion within this rapidly expanding industry by mandating extra reporting for transactions using cryptocurrencies. When seen from a more holistic viewpoint, these modifications represent a fundamental shift in the manner in which the government of the United States views the regulation of digital assets. An awareness of the growing incorporation of cryptocurrencies into conventional financial institutions is reflected in the law, which provides for the extension of regular currency transaction reporting requirements to cover digital assets. Nevertheless, these newly implemented reporting standards have not been without their share of arguments. Those who are opposed to them claim that they might place an excessive burden on cryptocurrency firms and could possibly hinder innovation within the industry. Despite this, some who support the measure believe that it is an essential step that must be taken in order to guarantee more accountability and transparency in the rapidly expanding market for digital assets.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The discussion that has been going on about the anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) for Bitcoin has recently been brought to light by comments made by two prominent figures in the world of cryptocurrencies. These individuals are Peter Schiff, a well-known gold investor and Bitcoin skeptic, and Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano. Concerns have been expressed by Peter Schiff, who is known for his continuous criticism of Bitcoin. Schiff is concerned about the buzz that is building up surrounding the possibility of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund being approved in the United States. Not because he is skeptical about the probability of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) receiving clearance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States, but rather because he is skeptical about the usefulness and need of such a product. In his advice to Bitcoin lovers, Schiff suggests that the prospect of an ETF approval has been fuelling Bitcoin's price and speculative demand for years. Schiff cautions Bitcoin enthusiasts to exercise cautious. Using the example of gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), he raises doubts about the need of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by pointing out that investors currently have the ability to purchase and hold Bitcoin without paying the charges that are associated with an ETF. Schiff is a proponent of gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an alternative investment that is more ideal. Charles Hoskinson, who is well-known for his straightforward manner and presence on social media, responded to Schiff's pessimism by making a hilarious observation on how early Schiff started voicing his misgivings this year. The statement made by Hoskinson draws attention to the continuing discussion and divergent points of view that exist within the bitcoin community with relation to the introduction of financial products such as Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The exchange that took place between these two personalities is representative of the larger discourse that is taking place in the cryptocurrency sector over the incorporation of cryptocurrencies into conventional financial products and the divergent viewpoints regarding the potential effect and usage of these coins. There are members of the cryptocurrency community that are more positive about the potential institutional adoption and wider acceptance that such financial products may bring to cryptocurrencies. Schiff is one of the individuals who expresses caution and doubt on the potential for such products to bring about. In conclusion, the discussion on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) exemplifies the spectrum of perspectives that exist within the cryptocurrency industry. These perspectives range from skepticism regarding the need and effect of these funds to excitement regarding their ability to encourage greater use and integration into existing financial systems.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-04",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, has initiated a major financial move by beginning the sale of $216 million worth of the company's stock options. This decision, disclosed through a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marks a significant step in Saylor's ongoing commitment to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Commitment Intensifies Saylor, a vocal advocate of Bitcoin, has outlined his plan to sell 310,000 stock option awards, which were originally granted in 2014 and are set to expire in April. He intends to execute this sale over the next four months, selling up to 5,000 shares per trading day, contingent on meeting a minimum price condition. This plan was initially revealed during MicroStrategy's third-quarter earnings call in 2023 and further detailed in that quarter's 10-Q filing with the SEC. Source: SEC The move is not just a financial maneuver but also a strategic one. Saylor expressed his intention to use the proceeds from these sales to address personal financial obligations and to acquire more Bitcoin for his personal account. This action underscores his belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin and his confidence in MicroStrategy's future. Post-sale, Saylor's equity stake in MicroStrategy will still be substantial, reinforcing his ongoing commitment to the company. MicroStrategy's Position in the Crypto Market MicroStrategy holds a prominent position in the cryptocurrency market, being the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. As of December, the company had approximately 189,000 BTC in its treasury, valued at around $8.5 billion based on current prices. This significant investment in Bitcoin has been a key part of MicroStrategy's financial strategy under Saylor's leadership. The company's stock value saw an 8.5% increase on Tuesday, contrasting with the broader market trend where cryptocurrency-focused stocks experienced a slump. This increase can be attributed to the market's positive response to Saylor's confidence in Bitcoin and MicroStrategy's robust position in the cryptocurrency landscape. Market Outlook and the Future of Bitcoin The current market dynamics show a promising outlook for Bitcoin. Trading around $45,000, Bitcoin's price has been on an upward trajectory in recent months. This growth is partly fueled by the anticipation of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Such an approval could significantly broaden Bitcoin's exposure to both retail and institutional investors, potentially driving its price and adoption further. In summary, Michael Saylor's decision to sell a substantial portion of his MicroStrategy shares to invest in Bitcoin highlights his unwavering belief in the cryptocurrency's potential. It also reflects his strategic vision for MicroStrategy's role in the evolving digital asset landscape. This move could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency market, especially if it signals increased confidence among institutional investors in Bitcoin's future. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "With the development of cryptocurrencies as a key factor in voting behavior, the landscape of American politics is seeing a revolutionary transition that is expected to have a substantial impact. A survey that was carried out not too long ago by the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) provides light on this phenomena, particularly in relation to the impending elections in the United States in the year 2024. From the results of a survey conducted by the CCI and published on January 2nd, it seems that the majority of people who are interested in cryptocurrencies may become an important voting group in the elections of 2024. This trend might be ascribed to the increasing significance of bitcoin in the public discussion as well as its junction with regulatory measures. As shown by the survey, an overwhelming majority of respondents (83%) who place a high priority on cryptocurrencies express a need for transparent regulations that control digital assets. This view is reflective of a larger need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency business, which has often found itself in a limbo in terms of the laws that govern the legal and financial aspects of the industry. In addition, the study indicates an intriguing phenomenon of crypto voters dividing their votes between candidates for the presidential election and those for legislative elections. The fact that these voters have a complex attitude to the issue of cryptocurrencies suggests that they may support various parties or candidates at different levels of government dependent on their position on the coin. The results of the survey reveal that 59% of respondents are inclined to support politicians who are knowledgeable about bitcoin issues. This further emphasizes the impact that cryptocurrency has on voting behavior. Moreover, over fifty percent of people believe that the stance that a candidate takes on cryptocurrencies is a deciding element in their decision regarding who they would vote for in the presidential election of 2024. The results are noteworthy when considered in the light of the close contests that are anticipated to take place in the next elections. It is possible that voters who are focused on cryptocurrency might play a particularly important role in shifting the result in areas that are tightly fought. It is interesting to note that the study also underlines the fact that while 89% of respondents had a positive opinion of bitcoin, their political inclinations differ, with 51% backing one presidential candidate over another. This rising tendency is indicative of a bigger storyline in which the candidates' awareness of cryptocurrency-related issues and their positions on those policies might play a significant influence in determining whether or not they are successful in the election. Because of the fact that the cryptocurrency business is continuing to develop and attract the attention of the general public, it is expected that its influence on political processes and results will expand. As a result, it will become a subject of great interest for both voters and politicians alike. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A recent conference held by the Chinese Association for the Study of Integrity and Legal Systems highlighted the rise of new forms of corruption facilitated by cryptocurrencies and electronic gift cards. This national organization, approved by the Chinese Law Society and registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, focuses on legal systems and corruption issues. Experts at the 2023 annual meeting discussed the challenges posed by these new mediums, which have become covert channels for bribery and corruption in the digital era. Traditional cash and tangible assets are no longer the only means of bribery; now, online transfers, electronic gift cards, and even cryptocurrencies are used for illicit transactions, enabling more discreet and hard-to-trace corrupt practices. The rapid advancement in digital currencies and blockchain technology poses a significant challenge to existing legal and regulatory frameworks. As these technologies offer anonymity and decentralization, they have become attractive tools for corrupt activities. Some corrupt individuals use encrypted digital currencies for cross-border transactions, avoiding online surveillance through \"cold storage\" methods like offline wallets and hard drives. The increasing use of virtual currencies and digital assets in corruption reflects a shift towards more sophisticated, technology-driven methods. This trend necessitates a dual approach of legal and technological governance. Strengthening legislation to cover new forms of bribery and corruption, expanding the definition of bribery to include non-material benefits, and enhancing the digital infrastructure for monitoring and enforcement are essential steps. Experts recommend establishing comprehensive databases and rapid analysis systems to improve case handling. Integrating core corruption data with industry-wide big data can enhance preventive measures against new forms of corruption. Additionally, understanding the legal status of virtual properties and regulating them effectively within criminal law is crucial. To effectively combat these emerging challenges, experts suggest refining anti-corruption legislation, enhancing the technological capabilities of monitoring and enforcement agencies, and fostering public participation in reporting corrupt activities. Addressing the root causes, such as gaps in the power and supervision systems, particularly in areas with high concentrations of power and resources, is also vital. In summary, combating new forms of corruption in the age of digital currencies and electronic gift cards requires a comprehensive approach, combining legislative updates, technological advancements, and societal vigilance to maintain integrity and fairness in governance.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A significant disagreement has arisen concerning the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin blockchain. Domo, the creator of the Bitcoin BRC-20 token standard, has publicly expressed opposition to an upcoming fork proposed by UniSat Wallet. This disagreement highlights a crucial debate in the crypto world about the balance between innovation and stability. On January 2, Domo, known for his role in the creation of the Bitcoin BRC-20 token standard, took to X platform (formerly Twitter) to voice his concerns. He stated that rushing these updates in BRC20 is reckless and could potentially harm the broader community of BRC20 users. His opposition stems from the belief that UniSat Wallet's proposed updates are being implemented too hastily, without proper consideration of the potential repercussions. The BRC-20 token standard is an experimental fungible token standard on Bitcoin. Inspired by Ethereum's ERC-20 standard, BRC-20 allows the creation of fungible tokens using Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol. It represents a significant innovation in the realm of cryptocurrency, enabling new forms of tokenization on the Bitcoin blockchain. UniSat Wallet, on the other hand, has announced its intention to follow the Ordinals Jubilee upgrade and ensure the continued operation of the BRC-20 protocol on Ordinals. This move by UniSat Wallet is described as a 'split' rather than a 'fork', adapting to the Ordinals Jubilee upgrade, a significant change in the Bitcoin blockchain's handling of tokenized assets. The crux of the issue lies in the method and pace of implementing these changes. Domo's concerns reflect a broader sentiment in the crypto community, where rapid advancements often clash with the need for stability and thorough vetting. The proposed changes by UniSat Wallet, while innovative, might be perceived as destabilizing by some members of the community, especially those heavily invested in the current BRC-20 standard. This development is crucial as it underscores the dynamic and often contentious nature of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency standards. As the technology evolves, differing opinions on the direction of such advancements are inevitable. The debate between Domo and UniSat Wallet is indicative of the larger conversations happening in the crypto space about how to balance progress with stability. In conclusion, the opposition from Domo against UniSat Wallet's proposed fork of the BRC-20 protocol represents a significant moment in the cryptocurrency sector. It highlights the challenges of innovating within a rapidly evolving technological landscape, where every change can have far-reaching implications for an entire community.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "There has been significant progress made in the cryptocurrency mining business in Kyrgyzstan, a nation that has abundant hydroelectric resources. A significant amount of 78.6 million soms, which is equivalent to around $883,000, was collected by the government of the country from cryptocurrency miners during the first eleven months of the year 2023. Compared to the 11.1 million soms (equivalent to $133,200) that were collected over the same time period in 2022, this amount represents a substantial rise. There was a fluctuation in tax receipts throughout the year 2023, with the lowest amount being 738,000 soms ($8,284) in February and the highest amount reaching 11.6 million soms ($130,212) in August. One of the most important aspects of this expansion is Kyrgyzstan's immense water resources, which include glaciers, lakes at high altitudes, and rivers that stretch for more than 35,000 kilometers. A significant portion of these resources are not being exploited to their full potential, since crypto miners mostly depend on hydropower for their operations. In point of fact, the majority of small hydroelectric power station owners in Kyrgyzstan are connected to cryptocurrency mining farms in the country. This synergy between natural resources and technology innovation is establishing Kyrgyzstan as an emerging hotspot in the world of cryptocurrency mining, comparable to nations such as Costa Rica and Paraguay who are also in the process of developing their mining industry. In July of 2023, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov gave his approval for the building of a cryptocurrency mining facility at the Kambar-Ata-2 Hydro Power Plant. This development contributed to the momentum that was already there. Through the implementation of this plan, the government demonstrates its dedication to maximizing the economic potential of its natural resources. On the other hand, it is important to remember that cryptocurrency miners in Kyrgyzstan are charged a rate that is five times more than the general population for the use of power. In spite of the optimistic income forecasts, the production of cryptocurrencies in Kyrgyzstan encountered difficulties in 2023. These difficulties included low dam fill levels and constraints on electricity distribution as a result of contracts with neighboring nations. Because of these concerns, miners were occasionally compelled to import electricity, which brought to light the challenges that still need to be addressed with regard to infrastructure. Nevertheless, by the beginning of October 2023, the sector had used a substantial 17 million kWh of power. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Anti-Surveillance State Act, which was introduced by Congressman Tom Emmer, symbolizes an increasing level of worry within the political landscape of the United States of America over the possible dangers that may be posed by a digital currency that is issued by the government. The passage of this legislation highlights the need of having a conversation about the future of money in the digital era, as well as the implications of government monitoring and financial privacy. The CBDC Anti-monitoring State Act, which was reintroduced by Tom Emmer, also known as the Majority Whip, is aimed at addressing the potential for increasing federal monitoring and control that may be enabled by a digital currency that is issued centrally. A central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be a government-issued digital currency that would operate on a digital ledger that is controlled by the government, in contrast to decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This central supervision raises worries about the possibility of carrying out monitoring on transactions and restricting the freedoms that individuals have in their financial lives. The fact that Emmer is going to reintroduce the law in 2023, after having proposed it for the first time in January 2022, highlights the critical nature of these issues in light of the rapidly changing digital financial sector. The primary purpose of the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act is to prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC directly to people. If this were to occur, the Fed would be transformed into a retail bank that would have access to personal financial data. In addition, the law intends to prevent the Federal Reserve from using a CBDC in order to carry out its monetary policy enforcement. The purpose of this initiative is to guarantee that a CBDC issued by the government does not become a tool for government monitoring, similar to the activities that are seen in authoritarian countries, if it is not designed to be open and private in the same way that cash exists. It is clear from the bill's precise provisions that the government is taking a cautious approach to welcoming developments in digital money while also placing an emphasis on individual privacy and financial liberty. Although the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act was initially supported by fifty co-sponsors, it has since garnered increasing support, with seventy-five members of Congress out of a total of five hundred thirty-five supporting the measure itself. There is a rising awareness and worry among politicians about the possible abuse of digital currencies for monitoring and control, which is highlighted by the increased support these currencies are receiving. The bill has attracted the attention of a variety of political and economic circles, with arguments centered on the difference between a model of digital money that is regulated by the government and an approach that is based on free market principles and protects customer data while encouraging innovation.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-02",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The digital currency landscape is bracing for a seismic shift as traditional banking giants prepare to enter the stablecoin arena. This move could redefine the market dynamics, challenging the current dominance of leaders like Tether. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX and CIO of Maelstrom, has provided critical insights into this emerging scenario. Hayes predicts that traditional banks are gearing up to enter the stablecoin market, which until now, has been largely dominated by entities like Tether. Despite their current success, centralized stablecoins could face serious challenges as banks, with their robust infrastructure, regulatory compliance capabilities, and deep-rooted customer trust, position themselves to overtake the market. Tether's current business model, thriving on interest rate differentials between dollar deposits and U.S. Treasury bills, could be easily replicated and potentially surpassed by these financial institutions. Hayes points out that centralized stablecoins have flourished primarily because of a void left by traditional banking systems, but this gap is set to close as banks recognize the lucrative opportunities in the stablecoin domain. Banks hold significant advantages over current stablecoin operators, including extensive experience in regulatory compliance and the trust of the masses. With the financial world\u2019s increasing movement towards stricter regulatory oversight, banks are in an advantageous position to adapt and thrive in the evolving stablecoin market. The trust factor plays a pivotal role, with consumers and businesses likely to prefer stablecoins backed by established banks over others. Moreover, while banks may initially lag in technological prowess compared to current stablecoin issuers, their vast resources would enable them to quickly catch up, making significant investments in blockchain technology and forming strategic partnerships with fintech companies. An interesting dimension to Hayes' predictions is the role of Bitcoin as the preferred currency for AI systems. He views Bitcoin, created through energy-intensive mining, as a perfect embodiment of monetary energy, aligning with AI systems' quest for efficiency and autonomy. As big banks make their foray into the stablecoin market, entities like Tether face multiple challenges, not just from the competition but also due to ongoing legal and transparency issues. Hayes concludes that the stablecoin market will continue to operate as it does, but the role of centralized crypto companies in it may diminish, leading to a fundamental shift in the industry.

        "creationDate": "2024-01-02",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has successfully carried out the 17th batch of its LUNC token burn mechanism, which is a major step for the Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) ecosystem. This most recent burn resulted in the withdrawal of an astounding 5.57 billion LUNC tokens from circulation, which represents a new milestone in the exchange's dedication to lowering the quantity of LUNC tokens. The most recent token burn that Binance carried out is a component of an ongoing plan to minimize the amount of Terra Luna Classic tokens that are already in circulation. The exchange has been actively engaged in the burn mechanism ever after Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao resigned from his position as CEO of the financial institution. Over 49 billion tokens have been burnt by Binance as a result of this most recent burn, which accounts for 53 percent of the total tokens that have been destroyed by the Terra Luna Classic community. When it comes to the LUNC market, the sequence of token burning that Binance has been doing has had a significant influence. As a result of the most recent burn, there was a substantial rise in the values of both LUNC and USTC tokens, with the value of LUNC witnessing an increase of 8%. This favorable market response highlights the effect that Binance's activities have had on the general attitude and dynamics that are present within the cryptocurrency market. Beyond token burning, Binance is involved in the Terra Luna Classic ecosystem in a variety of other ways. By implementing a number of different initiatives, the exchange has been a significant contributor to the improvement of trade volumes and interest in LUNC. This includes the launch of new trading pairs and perpetual contracts for USTC, both of which have contributed to the increased trading activity and visibility of Terra Luna Classic tokens. It is important to note that these developments have occurred. Despite the fact that the first reaction of the market to Binance's token burning has been favorable, traders and investors are encouraged to maintain a position of vigilance. Because of the volatility that is characteristic of the cryptocurrency market, there is a possibility that token values may fluctuate in the near future due to the possibility of profit booking. While the Terra Luna Classic community and Binance continue their efforts to stabilize and improve the value of LUNC, the larger market dynamics will play a significant part in determining the direction that the token will take.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Tether, which is widely considered to be the most renowned stablecoin issuers, took a bold step that caused shockwaves to spread across the cryptocurrency industry when it pulled 8,888.88 Bitcoin (BTC) off the Bitfinex platform on purpose. Tether was able to vault itself into the top 10 Bitcoin holders globally as a result of this transaction, which was estimated to be with a value of over 380 million dollars. Tether, which is mostly renowned for its capacity to create stablecoins that are pegged to fiat currencies, has been slowly establishing itself as a key player not just in the cryptocurrency sector as a whole but also in the cryptocurrency business specifically. Because of this most recent transaction, the total amount of Bitcoin that Tether possesses has climbed to 66,465.2 BTC. This has resulted in the cryptocurrency having a market worth of $2.9 billion according to the current market. This move, which is more than simply a financial transaction involving the cryptocurrency, demonstrates that Tether is capable of effectively navigating the unstable ecology that is associated with cryptocurrencies. Tether's strategic approach to retaining its cryptocurrency holdings was represented in the withdrawal, which was carried out on December 31, 2023. This decision was made on purpose and mirrored Tether's strategic strategy. Tether's position was not only reinforced as a consequence of this strategic measure, but it also resulted in a substantial profit of $1.15 billion, which is an astounding gain of around 70%. It is anticipated that Tether will be engaged in a number of significant transactions in the year 2023, and this new development is one of such transactions. As an example, on September 30, 2023, Tether raised the quantity of Bitcoins it had by 2,554.11 BTC. The fact that these activities seem to correlate with fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin is evidence that the investment strategy in issue is well-managed and has a clear aim.

        "articleSummary": "Bitcoin SV (BSV) has surpassed $100 due to strong technical indicators and market activity, especially in South Korea, influenced by market sentiment, technical analysis, and trading volume dynamics.",
        "creationDate": "2024-01-02",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin SV (BSV), which is a disputed fork of Bitcoin, has had a significant spike, and it has above the $100 threshold for the first time since April 2022. A spectacular reversal in its market value has occurred as a result of this large growth, which shows a striking increase of 108% over the course of the preceding week. There are a number of favorable technical indicators that are contributing to this rise. These indicators include a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), both of which indicate that significant upward momentum is occurring. In particular, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is a momentum indicator that is used in technical analysis, is now at a high of 87.08, which indicates that there is significant buying pressure despite the fact that it is in the overbought zone. Based on this information, it seems like Bitcoin SV may continue its upward trend in the not too distant future. Further evidence of a bullish trend is provided by the fact that the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of BSV over the period of 20 days is much higher than the EMA over the period of 50 days. These positive sentiments are also supported by the MACD histogram, which is a measure of the velocity of the market. The fact that it is presently at 5.47, which is an increase from the previous day, is an indication that the bullish momentum is becoming more intense. Upbit, a cryptocurrency exchange based in South Korea, has been a significant contributor to the recent price spike, since it is responsible for a hefty 65 percent of the trading volume of Bitcoin SV. This demonstrates that South Korean investors have a considerable effect on the dynamics of the Bitcoin SV market. New market activity in South Korea, particularly on Upbit, has been a key driving force behind this upsurge, underscoring the country's significant position in the cryptocurrency industry. This upsurge has been a major driving factor behind this upsurge. A notable surge has also been seen in the trading volume of Bitcoin SV, which has increased by 314.97% to reach $445 million in a span of twenty-four hours. It is abundantly obvious that the increasing investor interest and market activity around BSV is reflected in the spike in trade volume that has occurred. Recent price behavior of Bitcoin SV is a consequence of a mix of strong technical indications and tremendous market activity, notably in South Korea. This is especially true in South Korea. Because the cryptocurrency market is still in the process of developing, it is still unknown how Bitcoin SV will fare over the next several days and weeks. On the other hand, the present signs and the mechanics of the market point to this cryptocurrency maintaining its upward path. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2024-01-02",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In the year 2023, the proliferation of sophisticated phishing schemes has had a profound influence on the landscape of the bitcoin industry. The 2023 Wallet Drainers Report published by Scam Sniffer sheds light on the worrisome pace at which these scams have begun to spread, resulting in significant financial losses and victimizing a large number of people. Based on the findings of Scam Sniffer's investigation, a staggering amount of about $295 million worth of stolen assets was discovered, which affected around 324,000 victims. Phishing fraudsters are becoming more successful in employing more advanced tactics to circumvent security safeguards, as seen by this staggering number. Noteworthy is the fact that a substantial loss of seven million dollars was reported in the month of March. This loss was mostly caused by changes in USDC prices and consumers being duped by bogus Circle websites. This research makes a number of important observations, one of which is that wallet drainers are always evolving and being replaced. One indication that there is a solid underground market for such illegal services is the fact that when some drainers close their doors, the hole that they leave behind is swiftly filled by other con artists. For example, the closure of Monkey Drainer, which was responsible for high-profile phishing operations and an estimated loss of sixteen million dollars, resulted in the promotion of other scam services to the company's clients. Along the same lines, the closure of Inferno Drainer, which had been responsible for the theft of around $81 million, resulted in the establishment of a new company known as Angel Drainer. In addition to this, the research sheds light on a variety of methods that con artists use in order to attract victims and acquire traffic. The hacking of official Discord and Twitter accounts belonging to cryptocurrency projects and the dissemination of phishing links via posts is a common but not uncommon tactic. Phishing websites also draw organic traffic by executing false airdrops of crypto assets or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), abusing expired Discord links, and making use of spam comments and mentions on social media platforms. All of these methods are used to drive organic traffic. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that con artists have also been able to get around the advertising policies of Google and Twitter, which has enabled them to post sponsored advertisements on these platforms, therefore expanding their outreach even further.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-31",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Prosecutors in the United States have made the decision not to proceed with a second trial against Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which has since gone bankrupt. The FTX drama has reached a turning point with this judgment, which comes after the company was found guilty of stealing from clients a month ago. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy on November 2 by a jury. The charges were on the theft of $8 billion from FTX customers. As a result of this conviction, the former billionaire, whose personal wealth had earlier reached a staggering $26 billion, experienced a huge economic setback. The advantages of a second trial were assessed against the public interest in a speedy conclusion, which was a significant consideration for the prosecution. One of the factors that played a role in the judgment was the fact that Bankman-Fried is slated to be sentenced in March of 2024. It is anticipated that the sentence would include orders of forfeiture and restitution for victims. In addition, the majority of the evidence that may be used in a prospective second trial was previously provided in the first trial, which means that a second trial would be relatively necessary. It is possible that this ruling would speed up the process of providing compensation to those who were affected by the collapse of FTX. The fall of FTX and Bankman-Fried's conviction sent shockwaves across the whole world. For example, Temasek Holdings, an investment corporation based in Singapore, has indicated that it would be writing down its investment of $275 million in FTX, regardless of the result of the bankruptcy proceedings. This action brought to light the far-reaching effects that the FTX scandal had on investors and institutions and organizations all around the world. In addition, Temasek and other businesses, including as banks and venture capitalists, were accused of colluding with FTX to deceive investors, which led to the filing of a lawsuit against them. Bankman-Fried is anticipated to file an appeal of his conviction, despite the fact that he was found guilty. During the course of the trial, he argued that despite the fact that he committed operational errors at FTX, such as failing to form a risk management team, he did not knowingly steal monies from customers. In addition, he was under the impression that it was OK for his hedge fund, Alameda Research, to borrow money from FTX. He did not become aware of the fragile position of their finances until only a few moments before the collapse. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-29",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading desk RenrenBit was founded by Zhao Dong, who is notoriously known as the \"OTC King.\" Zhao Dong was found guilty in China of the charges against him. In the context of China's increasing crackdown on criminal operations using cryptocurrencies, this conviction is a major event that has taken place. In the course of his actions, Zhao was involved in the facilitation of cryptocurrency and local currency trading, which is considered to be unlawful in the nation. An in-depth investigation that dug into sophisticated financial dealings led to the conviction of the defendant. To build their case against Zhao and his friends, the authorities relied on a variety of evidence, including confessions, communication logs, financial records, and testimony from witnesses. Zhao and his colleagues made an effort to demonstrate that their conduct were restricted to transactions involving digital currency and did not constitute criminal trading in foreign exchange. The prosecution, on the other hand, presented proof of foreign exchange in their conversation logs, which was a response to their defense. As the trial progressed, it became clear that Zhao had received money from individuals from other countries. A comprehensive operation was revealed in which Zhao and other individuals in Dubai gathered funds in the form of dirhams, used these dirhams to purchase Tether, and eventually made it possible for local organizations to engage in the illicit resale of Tether for Chinese yuan (RMB). The verdict of the court resulted in Zhao being sentenced to seven years in jail and being had to pay a fine of 2.3 million Chinese yuan, which is equivalent to around $325,000. This verdict is illustrative of the stringent regulatory position that China takes against the trade of cryptocurrencies for financial purposes. Particularly via channels such as over-the-counter (OTC) desks, private chat groups, and transactions using stablecoins such as Tether, the case highlights the dangers that are connected with participating in cryptocurrency trading in places where it is strongly regulated or outlawed. In order to carry out his operation, Zhao Dong was responsible for carrying out intricate trading schemes using the Chinese yuan and other currencies. When conducting their investigation, the investigators focused their attention on the movement of funds between Chinese bank accounts, cash pools located abroad, and transactions using Tether and Bitcoin. Within the context of one of the schemes, Zhao was responsible for coordinating crypto-fiat transfers between businesses located in Dubai and domestic Chinese connections. This demonstrates a large network of financial activities that spans many nations. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-29",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The aftermath of the FTX collapse continues to unfold with significant developments in the cryptocurrency world. In a notable move, FTX debtors have filed a proposal to determine a fair and reasonable value for user claims based on digital assets. This proposal was submitted on December 27, 2023, to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. It suggests converting claims into dollar amounts pegged to crypto asset values as of November 11, 2022. The filing lists prices for approximately 500 assets in both fiat and cryptocurrency, based on values at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing. The proposed prices include $16,871 per Bitcoin (BTC), $1,258 for Ether (ETH), and $286 for Binance Coin (BNB). Notably, the table excludes an estimated FTX Token (FTT) price but includes prices for leveraged tokens, tokenized stocks, spot derivatives, and crypto futures. The FTX debtors have used data from Coin Metrics to estimate the digital asset prices. The court has broad discretion in choosing the method to estimate the valuation of claims based on digital assets. According to the bankruptcy code's section 502(b), claims must be assessed at the time of the Chapter 11 petition filing. This approach has been used in other crypto-related bankruptcy cases, including those involving Blockfi, Voyager Digital, and the Celsius Network. The court's pending approval of this motion will determine the final outcome. This estimation method has sparked strong objections from FTX users, who have not had access to their funds since November 2022. Many users feel they would miss out on gains from certain tokens, given the significant rise in cryptocurrency prices since the collapse. For instance, the price of Bitcoin has risen more than 150% since then. Users wishing to object to this estimation can send a letter to the Delaware bankruptcy court without needing a lawyer. The FTX claims are currently being traded on the Claims Market, a subsidiary of Cherokee Acquisition, at about $0.67 on the dollar. This trading platform also handles claims from other notable crypto bankruptcy cases like Celsius and Blockfi. The trading of these claims involves moving millions of dollars and reflects the ongoing market dynamics post-FTX collapse. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Chinese authorities have recently dismantled a massive underground banking network valued at $2.2 billion, which was ingeniously using foreign digital currency platforms to circumvent the country\u2019s stringent financial controls. This operation came to light following a detailed investigation by Chinese foreign exchange police. The underground banking system operated by purchasing virtual currencies and then selling them through overseas trading platforms, thereby obtaining the necessary foreign currency. This process effectively bypassed China's tight foreign exchange regulations. The inspector of the Qingdao Branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Xu Xiao, highlighted that this process involved illegal foreign exchange transactions, mainly converting yuan to other currencies. During the crackdown, authorities seized cryptocurrencies worth approximately $28,000, including Tether and Litecoin, among others. However, it's believed that the operation moved over $2.2 billion through more than a thousand bank accounts across 17 provinces and municipalities. This extensive network exemplifies the sophisticated and far-reaching nature of the illegal operation. China's strict regulations permit individuals to exchange only up to $50,000 in foreign currency annually unless officially authorized. Transactions beyond this limit without a permit are considered money laundering. This policy reflects China's efforts to maintain a \"closed\" capital account, preventing capital flight. China, once a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, imposed a blanket ban on crypto exchanges in 2017 and later expanded restrictions to mining and trading. Despite these prohibitions, underground operations continued, as evidenced by this recent bust. The Chinese government asserts that its strict stance on cryptocurrencies is to prevent illegal financial activities. Interestingly, while mainland China maintains a hostile stance towards cryptocurrencies, the special administrative region of Hong Kong is more progressive, implementing specific rules and licensing crypto exchanges. This discrepancy highlights the varied approaches to cryptocurrency regulation within and outside China. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In December 2023, Ripple (XRP), executed a significant transaction involving its XRP tokens. The company spent 240 million XRP, valued at approximately $148.80 million, strategically managing its escrowed reserves. This move left 96.34 million XRP in Ripple's principal spending wallet, marked \"Ripple (1)\", with an estimated value of $59.73 million, aimed at stabilizing the XRP market. Ripple's systematic management of its XRP reserves is a part of its broader strategy to stabilize the cryptocurrency market. The company operates under a well-defined escrow system, initiated in December 2017, designed to release 1 billion XRP monthly. To maintain market stability, Ripple typically re-locks 80% of these tokens back into escrow, with most of the remaining 20% transferred to its main wallet. This approach aims to balance the circulation of XRP tokens while mitigating the risk of market oversupply. The specific transactions carried out by Ripple in December 2023 were executed in three separate batches. On December 1, Ripple received 200 million XRP from a wallet labeled \u201CRipple (22)\u201D. Following this, the company distributed 60 million XRP on December 6, another 60 million on December 12, and 120 million XRP on December 20. These transactions resulted in the spending of 240 million XRP, reducing the balance in Ripple's main wallet to 96.34 million XRP. The aftermath of these transactions and Ripple's remaining reserves hold significant implications for the XRP market. While Ripple has the option to either sell the remaining 96.34 million XRP or retain them, their actions are expected to be strategic to avoid negatively impacting the XRP price. Additionally, with 40.7 billion XRP still locked in escrow, Ripple's ongoing management of these reserves will continue to influence the XRP market dynamics until at least 2027. Simultaneously, XRP's market performance in December 2023 marked a significant turnaround. After a five-year losing streak, XRP recorded a 5.18% gain, showcasing resilience and a potential shift in its market trajectory. This development reflects the adaptability of XRP in the volatile cryptocurrency market and indicates a possible revitalization of its market presence in the upcoming months.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-27",
        "detailedArticleContent": "As the deadline for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make a decision on the applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) draws near on January 10, 2024, the cryptocurrency and financial worlds are seeing a moment that has the potential to be historic. There has been a great deal of conjecture and debate among investors, legal experts, and industry watchers as a result of this decision, which is very important for the future of cryptocurrency trading in mainstream markets. Finding Your Way Through Legal and Strategic Complicated Cases Fred Rispoli, a well-known legal expert in the cryptocurrency area, is at the forefront of the conversation. He is contributing to the conversation. The SEC is attempting to strike a compromise between the demands of big financial organizations and the need to avoid legal penalties, and Rispoli has brought attention to the strategic maneuvering that the SEC is engaging in. His assertion is that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking a cautious approach by postponing its judgment on a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in order to prevent any hurried approval that may result in legal challenges. One interpretation of this intentional delay is that it is an attempt to please its customers, who are huge banks, while also avoiding the possibility of legal disputes. Possible Consequences of the SEC's Approvals There are rumors circulating that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would grant approval to many Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications before the deadline in January. It is not simply a single approval that is being anticipated; rather, it may be many approvals at the same time. A number of recent meetings between officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and representatives from a variety of asset management businesses have signaled an enhanced discussion, which has led to this conjecture. The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is noteworthy because it has the potential to encourage the broad acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the United States. This would therefore provide investors with a more regulated and mainstream channel for exposure to Bitcoin. The Last Countdown and Amendments to the Plan It has been reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has urged businesses who are competing for approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to submit any required modifications to their applications by the deadline of December 29, 2023. It is essential to meet this deadline in order to be considered for inclusion in the first round of approvals. It seems that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ready to approve many Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the beginning of 2024. A monetary redemption methodology for obtaining Bitcoin is included in the updated applications, which represents a departure from the conventional in-kind model used before. Because of this revision, it is quite possible that the structure of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the way in which they function in the market would be affected. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-27",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Grayscale Investments has amended its S-3 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move is aimed at transitioning the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Notably, the amendment follows the resignation of Barry Silbert as the chairman of Grayscale, marking a new chapter in the company's direction. Regulatory Compliance and Strategic Positioning Grayscale's amendment reflects a compliance with the SEC\u2019s guidelines, notably pivoting to accept only cash orders. This decision is not just a mere compliance tactic; it signifies a strategic shift. Grayscale is positioning itself to compete with significant players like BlackRock in the ETF market. This move is especially crucial as Grayscale prepares for a significant approval deadline in January. The company is adapting its structure, transitioning from a monthly to a daily fee structure and simplifying the share creation and redemption process, indicating readiness to make a substantial impact in the ETF arena. The Cash Creation Model A critical aspect of Grayscale\u2019s amended S-3 filing is the adoption of a cash creation model. This model means that new shares in a spot Bitcoin ETF can only be created or redeemed through cash transactions, contrasting with the in-kind model used by most stock and commodity-based ETFs, where fund market participants directly handle the asset in the fund. The shift to a cash creation model has been a significant point of contention between asset managers aiming to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF and the SEC. This move is seen as Grayscale \"finally surrendering\" to the cash creation model, a significant deviation from its previous stance. The SEC's preference for the cash creation model over direct dealings with Bitcoin is understood as an attempt to better monitor Bitcoin movements from exchanges and mitigate risks related to anti-money laundering or Know Your Customer compliance. This preference underlines the regulatory challenges faced by digital asset managers in navigating the complex landscape of financial regulations. The shift to a cash redemption model is expected to have profound implications on the cryptocurrency market, potentially challenging the profitable model of crypto exchanges and altering the financial landscape. Grayscale\u2019s move could set a precedent for other digital asset managers in navigating regulatory challenges. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-27",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The ongoing saga of the FTX bankruptcy has taken a new turn with the latest developments involving the acquisition of the stock-clearing platform Embed. FTX debtors, grappling with the fallout of the crypto exchange's collapse, have proposed a separate litigation settlement in the bankruptcy case, focusing specifically on this controversial acquisition. At the heart of this dispute is the acquisition of Embed, a deal completed for $220 million in June 2022 by FTX\u2019s U.S. arm. Notably, this acquisition was executed with minimal due diligence, as noted by FTX's legal representatives. In a significant move, FTX debtors have reached a proposed settlement with former CEO Sam \u201CSBF\u201D Bankman-Fried. This settlement pertains exclusively to the claims against him in the Embed case, aiming to recover the full value conferred by the simple agreements for future equity (SAFEs) upon Bankman-Fried and ensuring he relinquishes all assets held in his name at Embed. The details of the settlement include two SAFEs issued by FTX US to Bankman-Fried in 2022. These agreements necessitated Bankman-Fried to pay $160 million for rights to a number of shares in the crypto hedge fund. The proposed resolution ensures the return of all value from FTX US to which Bankman-Fried may be entitled. It's crucial to understand that this proposed agreement is limited in scope, addressing only specific aspects of the bankruptcy case related to Embed and Bankman-Fried. This agreement does not encompass all assets involved in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings. Following its filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, after Bankman-Fried's resignation and subsequent conviction of felony charges, FTX has been actively managing creditor claims and consolidating assets, including a recent move to pool assets with its Bahamian arm, FTX Digital Markets. Despite this settlement, FTX debtors continue to pursue other claims against the former CEO and executives. In May, FTX filed lawsuits in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware against former insiders, including Bankman-Fried, Embed executives, and shareholders, seeking to reclaim over $240 million paid for Embed. The acquisition of Embed, completed just weeks before FTX's collapse, is a focal point of controversy. FTX lost billions in customer funds, a situation its current CEO John Ray attributed to \"old-fashioned embezzlement\". Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Former Binance CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao has witnessed a significant surge in his wealth over the past year. Since December 2022, his net worth has increased by an estimated $25 billion. This remarkable growth has elevated his total net worth to $37.2 billion. Such a substantial increase is not only a testament to Zhao's financial acumen but also highlights the dynamic nature of wealth in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Zhao's financial ascent comes amidst a backdrop of legal challenges. He recently pleaded guilty to U.S. criminal charges and stepped down as CEO of the crypto exchange Binance. Despite these legal setbacks, his financial standing has not only remained robust but has significantly prospered. This scenario underscores the often complex and unpredictable relationship between legal challenges and financial success in the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as of late December 2023, ranks Zhao as the 35th richest individual globally, a position that reflects both his personal success and the growing influence of cryptocurrency in global finance. His journey from the head of Binance to one of the world's wealthiest individuals is indicative of the rapid wealth generation potential within the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. The cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility and high potential for gains, has played a significant role in Zhao's wealth accumulation. The market's rebound and growth in 2023 have directly impacted the fortunes of many in the sector, with Zhao being a prime example. His wealth increase mirrors the broader trends in the crypto market, highlighting how closely tied personal fortunes are to market dynamics in this industry. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently come under scrutiny for its handling of a legal case against Debt Box, a mining software firm. In a rare admission, the SEC has acknowledged significant errors in its approach to the case, sparking discussions in the legal and cryptocurrency communities. The case, originating from a July lawsuit, accused Debt Box of defrauding investors through a $50 million crypto scheme involving unregistered securities. The SEC had obtained a temporary restraining order to freeze the firm's assets, asserting that Debt Box was attempting to evade jurisdiction by moving assets abroad. However, this narrative was challenged when the court found insufficient evidence to support the SEC's claims, leading to the order's rescission in October. Judge Robert Shelby, overseeing the case, criticized the SEC for making \"false or misleading\" statements, which he believed damaged the integrity of the proceedings and caused irreparable harm to Debt Box. This criticism highlighted a significant deviation from the expected legal standards of accuracy and candor by the SEC. Responding to these allegations, the SEC expressed deep regret over its errors, admitting to not being \"accurate and candid\" in its representations. This admission is pivotal, considering the commission's role as a regulatory authority in the financial sector. Gurbir Grewal, the SEC enforcement director, apologized for the commission's shortcomings, highlighting the importance of presenting accurate evidence in court. He announced that starting January 2024, the enforcement division would undergo additional training to prevent similar incidents. In light of these developments, the SEC has replaced the attorneys handling the case and is instituting mandatory training for its staff to reinforce the importance of accuracy and the need to correct any inaccuracies promptly. This case has garnered attention, especially from entities in the crypto space, due to its implications for how regulatory bodies interact with emerging technologies and financial platforms. Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, commented on the SEC's behavior in the Debt Box case as \"shocking,\" emphasizing the consequences of the SEC's actions on the affected businesses. The SEC's admission and the ensuing legal developments are a rare rebuke by a court, as the commission is involved in multiple enforcement cases against prominent firms like Kraken, Binance, Ripple, Coinbase, and Terraform Labs.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "His current business, X (previously known as Twitter), is expanding into new regions with the projected debut of in-app payment services by the middle of 2024. Elon Musk, the brilliant mind behind firms such as SpaceX and Tesla, is pushing his latest endeavour into new territory. This action is considered to be a component of Musk's master plan to convert X into a \"everything app,\" a notion that has garnered a great deal of attention and discussion because of its potential. In a chat that took place on December 21 with Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, Musk provided specifics about his ambitions for X. He said that he is optimistic that a payment mechanism would be completely included into the platform by the middle of the next year. However, the success of this ambitious plan is contingent upon the acceptance of several applications for money transmitter licences. Musk acknowledges that the implementation of this process has been delayed down by the processes of the bureaucracy. Although it is well known that Musk has a certain fondness for cryptocurrencies, particularly Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin (BTC), his current emphasis for X's payment services seems to be less oriented towards the incorporation of cryptocurrencies. Musk's businesses, such as Tesla and The Boring Company, have shown in the past that they are willing to take cryptocurrency. Approximately 148 million dollars worth of Bitcoin is still held by Tesla, and the company also enables consumers to pay for items using Dogecoin. Additionally, in the year 2022, The Boring Company started taking Dogecoin as payment for trips on their public transportation system in Las Vegas. Nevertheless, Musk recently downplayed his interest in digital assets by saying, \"I don't spend a lot of time thinking about cryptocurrency.\" This statement was made in answer to a query that was presented by Grok, which is Musk's own artificial intelligence project. A little amount at all.\" Despite the fact that he emphasised the need of being vigilant against currency manipulations, this comment indicates that there may be a move away from a concentration that was previously centred on cryptocurrencies. As X is set to bring out this significant function, it has already obtained a critical Pennsylvania licence, which will allow it to facilitate money transfers in a manner comparable to those of services such as Venmo. The realisation of Musk's vision for the platform is a huge step forward, and this new breakthrough is a significant stride. In line with Musk's optimistic outlook, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of the company, also sees 2024 as a significant year for the development of the platform. On social media, the successful debut of the payment system has the potential to revolutionise the way users connect with one another by combining the sharing of ideas with the conduct of financial transactions.

        "detailedArticleContent": "It is planned that Gary Gensler, the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), would meet with Lee Bok-hyun, the Chief of South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). This meeting is expected to be of critical importance. As reported by Chosunbiz on December 18, this conference, which is scheduled to take place in January, is a proactive approach to examining the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market as well as prospective supervisory measures. The timing of this conference is especially important when taking into consideration the current changes that are occurring in the regulatory landscapes of both the United States of America and South Korea. It has been speculated that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would soon give its approval to a number of exchange-traded products including Bitcoin. In the meanwhile, it is anticipated that South Korea will impose new rules by July 2024, which would have a big influence on cryptocurrency traders and exchanges. The significance of these high-level meetings is highlighted by the fact that the regulatory landscape is constantly changing. In addition, the situation with Do Kwon, who was a co-founder of Terraform Labs, causes the regulatory landscape to become even more convoluted. The fact that Kwon is struggling with legal issues in a number of different nations, including the possibility of being extradited to the United States, adds another degree of complication to the discussions that Lee and Gensler are having. The existence of this issue is illustrative of the complex relationship that exists between international law and the decentralized structure of cryptocurrency. To this point, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has only authorized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are tied to bitcoin futures. This is because Gary Gensler has been in charge of the SEC. Determinations on spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are being keenly anticipated by the industry, particularly with regard to big cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. There is a possibility that the impending discussion between Lee and Gensler may offer insight on potential future regulatory measures around this region. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The legal proceedings involving former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried took a significant turn recently when U.S. federal judge Lewis Kaplan denied Bankman-Fried's request for an adjournment of his sentencing hearing. This decision has implications for the timeline of the case and highlights the complexities surrounding high-profile legal cases in the cryptocurrency world. Request for Adjournment Denied On December 20, Sam Bankman-Fried, through his legal team, submitted a letter requesting a four-to-six-week adjournment of his sentencing hearing, which was originally scheduled for March 28, 2024. The purpose of this request was to provide additional time for defense preparation, including a delay for his presentencing interview, initially set for December 21. The defense team sought a rescheduling of the sentencing hearing to early to mid-May 2024. Judge Kaplan's Rationale Judge Lewis Kaplan, presiding over the case, refused the request. His decision was influenced by the fact that Bankman-Fried had already been granted an extension on November 18 to file sentence submissions. Judge Kaplan noted that the current sentencing date was set without any objections from the defendant. This refusal to adjourn the sentencing hearing maintains the original schedule, keeping the presentencing interview and sentencing hearing dates unchanged. The denial of the adjournment request by Judge Kaplan is a crucial development in the case of Sam Bankman-Fried, a notable figure in the cryptocurrency industry. The decision to proceed as scheduled emphasizes the judicial system's commitment to timely proceedings and highlights the challenges faced by defendants in complex financial cases. The outcome of this case will be closely monitored, given its significance in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-22",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In the year 2022, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which had previously been a well-known brand in the bitcoin hedge fund industry, was confronted with a catastrophic failure. This decrease was not simply a single occurrence; rather, it was a trigger in a chain of domino events that occurred, which caused the cryptocurrency market to be shaken. The court in the British Virgin Islands has taken quick action by freezing assets associated to the fund's founders, Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, as well as Davies' wife, Kelly Chen, with a potential value of up to $1.14 billion. Mismanagement and excessive exposure to the unpredictable cryptocurrency market are the core causes of the collapse that occurred at 3AC. It is alleged by liquidators from Teneo that the conduct of the fund's founders rendered the fund extremely susceptible to swings in the market, so wiping its capital buffer against an astounding $3.3 billion in liabilities. In the aftermath of the collapse of Terra in 2022, which triggered a chain reaction of ramifications among the business, this vulnerability became more obvious. The collapse of 3AC has ramifications that go beyond the financial damages that it has caused. Founders Zhu and Davies are now being investigated by the legal system, with Zhu being subjected to in-depth interrogation in a court in Singapore over the collapse of the fund and the locations of its assets. The arrest of Zhu at Changi Airport in Singapore and the subsequent interrogation of him highlight the need of effective worldwide coordination of regulatory activities. As a response, Singapore has prohibited Zhu and Davies from participating in any activity that is regulated within its jurisdiction. This action reflects a growing worldwide agreement on the increasing need of implementing rigorous regulations around cryptocurrencies. There have been extensive repercussions for the cryptocurrency industry as a result of the breakdown of 3AC. The cryptocurrency market had a major decline of $2 trillion as a result of its contribution, which in turn triggered a number of subsequent crashes within the industry. As a result of this occurrence, the fragility and interconnection of the cryptocurrency market have been brought to light, highlighting the need for more strong regulatory frameworks and risk management methods.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-22",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has recently concluded a landmark legal process, officially sanctioning the confiscation of 69,370 Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies from the defunct dark web marketplace Silk Road. This judicial action enforces a previous ruling that acknowledged the U.S. government's rightful claim to these digital assets, which were linked to Silk Road's notorious illegal operations. The origins of this case trace back to 2020 when the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) seized cryptocurrencies valued at over $1 billion. Following this seizure, a legal motion was filed for the official forfeiture of these assets. The confiscated Bitcoin, at the time of seizure, had a market value exceeding $1 billion but has since appreciated to a worth of over $3 billion. Silk Road, established and operated by Ross Ulbricht from 2011 to 2013, gained infamy as an online platform for the sale of drugs, weapons, and other illegal goods. The FBI intervened in 2013, leading to the site's closure and Ulbricht's arrest. Subsequently, Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering and running a criminal enterprise. In a significant move, Ulbricht agreed in 2022 to employ $3 billion worth of stolen Bitcoin to offset his debt to the U.S. government and relinquished his claim to 69,370 Bitcoins. The narrative of Silk Road's Bitcoin also involves an individual known as \u201CIndividual X,\u201D later identified as James Zhong. Zhong had hacked into Silk Road, usurping control of its funds. In April, he received a federal prison sentence for his actions. Notably, in July, the DOJ-associated cryptocurrency wallet executed transactions involving approximately 9,825.25 Bitcoin, valued at around $299 million, connected to Silk Road. The U.S. government, now in possession of these Bitcoin assets, has them under the administration of various federal entities, including the DOJ and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The total value of Bitcoin assets currently held by the U.S. government, stemming from various illegal activities, is estimated to be around $5.4 billion. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-21",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, recently addressed the political landscape in the United States regarding cryptocurrencies. He believes that a strong anti-crypto stance by politicians may be a poor strategic move for the upcoming 2024 elections. This opinion comes in the context of the evolving digital asset landscape and increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies among American citizens. Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, introduced by U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall, is central to this discussion. This bipartisan legislation aims to integrate the digital asset ecosystem with existing anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing regulations. The Act proposes extending the Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities to include various actors in the digital asset space, such as wallet providers and miners. It also addresses \"unhosted\" digital wallets and seeks to prohibit financial institutions from using anonymity-enhancing technologies in digital asset transactions. The Act represents a significant push towards bringing the digital asset sector under stricter regulatory oversight. The Increasing Adoption of Cryptocurrencies Armstrong's argument is bolstered by the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. He cites several statistics to support his view: 52 million American citizens currently hold crypto, and 38% of young people see cryptocurrencies as a means to enhance economic opportunities. Furthermore, crypto prices have risen significantly, reflecting a growing dissatisfaction with the traditional financial system. These trends suggest that a political stance against cryptocurrencies might not resonate well with a significant portion of the electorate. Concerns Over Data and Implications It's important to note that while Armstrong's assertions are compelling, he did not provide sources for the data he mentioned. Most of the numbers he cited appear to come from a Coinbase report published in October 2023. The information is based on surveys conducted primarily by Morning Consult in the summer and fall of 2023. The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly relevant as the U.S. approaches the 2024 elections. Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong highlights the potential strategic misstep for politicians adopting an anti-crypto stance, considering the growing adoption and interest in digital assets among the American populace.

        "detailedArticleContent": "7RCC, an ESG-conscious company, has recently applied for a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), marking a significant stride in the fusion of cryptocurrency investment with environmental sustainability. This innovative financial instrument aims to cater to investors who are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in their investment decisions. Central to the 7RCC Bitcoin ETF is its unique investment composition. The fund dedicates 80% of its capital base to actual Bitcoin (BTC) investments, while the remaining 20% is allocated to carbon credit futures. This structure is designed to offset the environmental impact traditionally associated with Bitcoin mining, a concern that has been a point of criticism for cryptocurrencies. By incorporating carbon credit futures, 7RCC aims to provide a carbon-neutral trading strategy, addressing the growing demand for sustainable investment options in the crypto market. Gemini: A Strategic Custodial Choice In a departure from the norm, where most Bitcoin ETF applicants have preferred Coinbase Exchange as their custodian, 7RCC has chosen Gemini. This decision signifies a strategic move by 7RCC, opting for Gemini's expertise to manage the Bitcoin component of the ETF. Gemini's role as a custodian is crucial in ensuring the security and regulatory compliance of the Bitcoin assets under management. 7RCC\u2019s Market Position and Future Outlook 7RCC, by entering the Bitcoin ETF arena, joins the ranks of other notable firms like Ark 21Shares, Grayscale, and BlackRock. However, its ESG-centric approach differentiates it significantly from its competitors. The proposed ETF by 7RCC stands out as a pioneer in integrating cryptocurrency investment with a strong commitment to environmental sustainability. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs in the near future. The approval of 7RCC\u2019s ETF would not only broaden the range of investment vehicles available but also set a precedent for carbon-neutral strategies in cryptocurrency investments.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Coinbase, the United States' largest cryptocurrency exchange, has escalated its legal confrontation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This significant legal battle, unfolding in the Third Circuit court, is not just a corporate skirmish but a defining moment in the broader dialogue about cryptocurrency regulation in America. Coinbase's Assertive Appeal Coinbase's legal challenge stems from the SEC's refusal to respond to its petition for rulemaking on cryptocurrency. After a prolonged 18-month silence from the SEC, Coinbase turned to the courts to compel a response, a move that aligns with the industry's call for clearer regulatory guidelines. Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, in a bold public statement, underscored the company's determination to seek judicial intervention against what they perceive as the SEC's failure to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities. SEC's Firm Stance Under the leadership of Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has maintained a rigid stance, emphasizing its discretion in setting regulatory priorities and asserting the applicability of existing laws to the crypto securities market. Gensler's defense of the Commission's decision highlights a fundamental conflict: the balancing act between adhering to established rules and adapting to the evolving landscape of digital currencies. The conflict between Coinbase and the SEC goes beyond these two entities, reflecting a larger debate over the regulatory jurisdiction in the cryptocurrency sector. This dispute underlines the urgency for clear and workable regulatory frameworks that can foster industry growth while ensuring investor protection. The outcome of this legal confrontation could have significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States, potentially setting precedents for how digital currencies are governed.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Lido DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization governing the liquid staking protocol Lido, is currently embroiled in a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed by former LDO holder Andrew Samuels, alleges that Lido's LDO token is an unregistered security and holds Lido DAO liable for the financial losses incurred due to the token's price decline. Lido is a prominent protocol in the blockchain ecosystem, enabling users to stake their Ether (ETH) and receive staking rewards. Users get a derivative token called stETH, which can be utilized in various applications. The Lido DAO, comprising LDO token holders, is responsible for governance decisions within this protocol. Lido stands out in the DeFi space, having locked more than $19 billion worth of cryptocurrency in its contracts, marking it as the largest in terms of total value locked for any liquid staking derivative. Details of the Lawsuit The class-action lawsuit was filed in a San Francisco United States District Court on December 17, 2023. Andrew Samuels, the plaintiff, is a resident of Solano County, California. He asserts that the LDO token, governed by Lido DAO, is an unregistered security according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's criteria. The lawsuit includes defendants such as Lido DAO, AH Capital Management LLC, Paradigm Operations LP, Dragonfly Digital Management LLC, and Robot Ventures LP. These entities are alleged to hold significant control over LDO tokens, limiting the influence of regular investors on governance issues. The Core Allegation Samuels' main contention is that the Lido DAO began as a general partnership led by institutional investors, later transitioning to public token sales for potential exit opportunities. The lawsuit alleges that centralized exchanges were persuaded to list LDO tokens, leading to their purchase by Samuels and other investors. Following the listing, the token's price fell, leading to significant losses for these investors. The complaint leverages a statement from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, suggesting that the LDO token is a security because it involves a group between the tokens and investors, with the public expecting profits from this group's actions. The case, filed under case number 4:2023cv06492, is being presided over by Judge Donna M. Ryu in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. It focuses on allegations of securities fraud under 15 U.S.C. § 77. The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant implications for the Lido DAO, LDO token holders, and the broader DeFi and blockchain community, particularly regarding the classification and regulation of tokens as securities.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Zooko Wilcox, the founder of Zcash, has stepped down from his position as the CEO of Electric Coin Company (ECC), which is responsible for the development of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash (ZEC). Wilcox, who has been at the helm since the company's inception in 2015, played a pivotal role in fostering the development of Zcash, which debuted in 2016. Under his leadership, Zcash emerged as a prominent privacy cryptocurrency, reaching significant trading values shortly after its release. The Rise of Josh Swihart Taking over the reins from Wilcox is Josh Swihart, who previously held the role of Senior Vice President of Growth at ECC. Swihart has been a part of ECC for nearly five years and brings a rich background in entrepreneurship, technology, and product development to the CEO role. His experience and leadership qualities are expected to drive the company forward, focusing on product-market fit, unlocking new partnerships, enhancing Zcash's usability, and increasing adoption. Swihart's appointment reflects a strategic move to iterate more quickly, improve Zcash's utility, and establish ECC's financial sustainability. Wilcox's Legacy and Future Plans Wilcox's decision to step down was influenced by his personal realization that his identity had become overly conflated with Zcash, which he did not believe was beneficial for either him or the cryptocurrency. Despite stepping down as CEO, Wilcox will continue to serve as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, ECC's parent company. His future endeavors will remain committed to the cause of human freedom, a value he has passionately upheld throughout his tenure. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Major companies in the market, such as BlackRock and ARK Invest, have modified their S-1 registration statements in order to comply with the requirements imposed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. When it comes to their planned spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), this update includes a significant move toward a cash redemption approach. This strategic decision, which was signified by the submission of these revisions on December 18, 2023, symbolizes the embrace of a cash creation and redemption model over the in-kind redemptions that had been pursued in the past. Generally speaking, in-kind redemptions entail transactions that do not require monetary exchanges, such as the direct use of Bitcoin (BTC). This adjustment is in accordance with the standards that have been established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF is particularly mentioned in the registration statement of ARK Invest, which highlights the company's change to accepting solely cash creations and redemptions. When it comes to prospective in-kind agreements, the statement does provide opportunity for them; however, this is contingent upon receiving regulatory permission. In a similar vein, BlackRock has echoed this stance, highlighting the possibilities of in-kind transactions, but this is reliant upon receiving approval from regulatory authorities. Because of the SEC's insistence on a \"cash-only\" strategy, authorized participants in these exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are now required to supply cash in order to purchase more shares. Unlike the \"in-kind\" technique, which allows investors to directly swap the asset that the ETF monitors (in this instance, Bitcoin) for ETF shares, this approach takes a different approach. The cash-only strategy seeks to provide better transparency on the sources of the Bitcoin that serves as the basis for the exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would presumably acquire the Bitcoin from reputable exchanges. The reaction from the industry has been inconsistent. Eric Balchunas, an analyst for Bloomberg ETFs, adds that ARK and its partner 21Shares first rejected the cash generation approach. In fact, they even came up with an alternate mechanism for in-kind redemptions. Their final compliance is an indication of the SEC's tough attitude on the subject, and the analyst suggests that this might pave the way for the possibility of an approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as early as January. This new move is a part of a larger trend in which entities that issue exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as WisdomTree, a worldwide supplier of ETFs, have been required to conform to the SEC's preference for cash redemptions. This strategy move among large firms such as BlackRock and ARK Invest represents a substantial adaptation to regulatory restrictions, and it may signal the beginning of a new phase in the development of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by bringing about a new phase.

        "detailedArticleContent": "FTX, once a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency exchange market, has been embroiled in a costly bankruptcy case. Between August 1 and October 31, the legal fees charged by the bankruptcy lawyers and advisers handling FTX's case have skyrocketed to a staggering $118.1 million. This amount averages out to approximately $53,300 per hour, a rate reflective of the complex nature of the bankruptcy proceedings and the high-profile status of the FTX case. The management consulting firm Alvarez and Marshall has emerged as the top biller in this scenario, charging an immense $35.8 million for their services over the three-month period. This is closely followed by the global law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, which billed $31.8 million. These figures underscore the intensity and breadth of the legal and management consulting efforts involved in navigating the intricate web of issues surrounding FTX's bankruptcy. The immense legal fees are not just a standalone issue; they have broader implications. For instance, the costs incurred for other professional services related to forensic investigations have also been significant, with AlixPartners alone charging $13.3 million over the year. Such exorbitant fees raise concerns regarding the impact on the availability of funds for creditor reimbursement and the overall financial recovery process for FTX. FTX's bankruptcy case has resulted in exceptionally high legal and advisory fees, totaling $118.1 million between August and October, averaging $53,300 per hour. Alvarez and Marshall topped the billing, highlighting the costly and complex nature of this high-profile bankruptcy proceeding. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The UK government has recently made a significant stride in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. On December 18, 2023, they announced the introduction of the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS) as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023. This groundbreaking initiative, set to become operational on January 8, 2024, is designed to foster innovation in the financial sector by allowing crypto firms to test their products and services within a controlled environment in the UK. A New Era for Financial Technology The DSS represents a new era for financial technology in the UK. By facilitating the testing of emerging technologies in financial market infrastructure activities, the sandbox aims to encourage the development and application of digital assets and related technologies in the financial sector. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England will oversee the sandbox, ensuring a regulatory framework that supports innovation while maintaining consumer protection. Boosting Crypto Firms and Technologies The introduction of the DSS is a boon for crypto firms looking to explore and expand their services in the UK. These firms will have the opportunity to test distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenize traditional securities. This move aligns with the global trend of financial institutions embracing tokenization and digital assets. The sandbox will allow firms and regulators to trial new technologies, including those involved in central securities depository activities like notary, settlement, and maintenance, as well as operating trading venues. Regulatory Progress and Consumer Protection The establishment of the DSS is a part of the broader regulatory framework established by the Financial Services and Markets Act. This framework is designed to foster innovative technologies while ensuring adequate consumer protection. In addition to the sandbox, the UK government has taken steps to regulate the use of digital assets and combat their illegal use. The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill, passed in October, gives authorities the power to seize cryptocurrencies and lays the groundwork for regulating stablecoins.

        "articleSummary": "The SEC has postponed its decision on several Ether ETFs, including Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, affecting the future of Ethereum-based financial products.",
        "creationDate": "2023-12-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stated that it would postpone its judgment on various exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are based on Ether (ETH) until May 2024. This is a big event for the cryptocurrency sector. There are major exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals that are impacted by this delay. These include the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF and the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF. The Delay and its Implications Regulatory documents made on December 18 disclosed the decision made by the SEC, which extends the review time for these exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Hashdex Ether ETF, which intends to hold both spot Ether and futures contracts, and Grayscale's Ethereum Futures ETF, which is considered as a possible gateway to transforming its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF, are two of the most impacted exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed its decision on the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF as well as a similar ETF that was submitted by Cathie Wood's ARK Invest; 21Shares. Public Input and Previous Approvals Currently, the SEC is in the process of soliciting more public feedback on whether or not these exchange-traded funds (ETFs) should be listed. The authority seems to be taking a cautious approach toward the approval of spot or mixed-type Ethereum products, as shown by this step. The SEC has not yet given its approval to any spot or mixed-type Ethereum exchange-traded funds, despite the fact that it had previously authorized Ethereum futures ETFs. Market Analyst Perspectives According to James Seyffart, an analyst for Bloomberg ETFs, these delays were something that was expected and were likely to take place before December 25. He brought out the fact that the final decision from the regulatory body is anticipated to be made by the end of May 2024. The SEC's decision to postpone the implementation of cryptocurrency-based financial products brings to light the regulatory obstacles and scrutiny that these products endure. Over the course of the ongoing development of the cryptocurrency market, the choices made by regulatory agencies such as the SEC are being carefully monitored for the possible influence they might have on the dynamics of the market and the involvement of investors.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-18",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In light of the fact that Taiwan is getting ready to hold its presidential election on January 13, 2024, a crucial advice has been given to the people of Taiwan about betting on cryptocurrencies. A thorough investigation into the use of cryptocurrency platforms for betting on the result of the presidential election has been begun by the authorities in Taiwan. This inquiry has brought to light the ethical and legal considerations that are associated with such behaviors. There is a significant amount of anxiety among the authorities in Taiwan over the use of bitcoin betting websites. In the midst of the enthusiasm surrounding the impending election, this notice is being sent with the intention of discouraging locals from participating in gambling activities that might possibly be unlawful. This warning is being issued as a result of events in which Taiwanese individuals have purportedly utilized such platforms, which has led to a more comprehensive examination into these activities. A total of seventeen people have been put into custody as a direct consequence of the serious action taken by the Taiwanese authorities against internet betting on the presidential election. Over five thousand five hundred dollars worth of USD Coin, a cryptocurrency that is tied to the United States Dollar, was taken away from people who were jailed as a result of the raid. This action demonstrates the government's commitment to combatting unlawful internet gambling, particularly in situations where it crosses with the electoral process. The utilization of Polymarket, which is a decentralized betting platform, is at the heart of this matter of contention. It has been determined that Taiwanese residents consistently choose it as their preferred option when it comes to putting wagers on the presidential election. The absence of a central authority or control mechanism that these platforms possess presents regulators with a unique set of issues due to the decentralized structure of these platforms. The caution against the use of cryptocurrency betting platforms serves as a reminder of the legal limitations and ethical issues that are involved in activities of this kind. This warning comes as the presidential election in Taiwan begins to draw closer. A increasing worldwide trend of analyzing the junction between cryptocurrencies and conventional industries, including as politics and gaming, is reflected in the aggressive position taken by the government of Taiwan.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-18",
        "detailedArticleContent": "FTX's debtors have filed an amended Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, which marks a significant development in the ongoing bankruptcy case of the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange. This revised plan includes a crucial provision that sets the value of cryptocurrency claims based on their cash value at the time of FTX's bankruptcy filing on November 11, 2022. This decision comes amidst a fluctuating cryptocurrency market, where the value of many digital assets, including Bitcoin, has seen notable recovery since the bankruptcy date. Impact on Creditors and Market Recovery The bankruptcy of FTX had a profound impact on the cryptocurrency market, contributing to a dip in values. However, since the filing, the market has shown considerable recovery, with the global crypto market cap increasing significantly. This upswing in market values poses a stark contrast to the situation at the time of FTX's bankruptcy, which has implications for the creditors. Under the amended plan, creditors may potentially miss out on the gains realized in the market post-bankruptcy. This is especially poignant considering that even FTX's own token has almost doubled in value since the filing. Controversy Surrounding the Plan The reorganization plan has sparked controversy, particularly among FTX's creditors. Sunil Kavuri, a notable FTX creditor, has criticized the plan, stating that it contradicts FTX's Terms of Service, which had assured that customers owned the titles to their digital assets, not the exchange. This argument is underscored by the conviction of FTX's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, on charges of defrauding customers, highlighting the alleged misappropriation of customer-owned digital assets. Voting and Approval Process Creditors of various classes will have the opportunity to vote on this amended reorganization plan. The plan requires certain thresholds of approval, both in terms of dollar amount and number of claimants, to be implemented. In some scenarios, even if certain classes of creditors do not agree with the plan, a \"cram-down\" process may enforce it, provided it is deemed \"fair and equitable.\" This complex process underscores the challenges in navigating the bankruptcy proceedings and balancing the interests of different stakeholders. In parallel developments, FTX has been authorized to sell a significant amount of trust assets, aiming to use these proceeds to repay creditors. Additionally, the FTX 2.0 Customer Ad Hoc Committee has proposed revisions to the reorganization plan, seeking a fair balance among stakeholder interests. The case is further complicated by ongoing scrutiny of crypto assets linked to both FTX and Alameda Research, including reports of significant digital asset transfers from wallets associated with these entities. The legal saga surrounding FTX continues with the conviction of founder Sam Bankman-Fried for defrauding customers and lenders. Legal experts anticipate a potential prison term of 15-20 years, significantly below the theoretical maximum. Key figures from Alameda Research and FTX have admitted to fraudulent activities under Bankman-Fried's direction, but may receive minimal prison time due to their cooperation. However, they could still face substantial financial penalties, including the return of ill-gotten gains and restitution payments to victims. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-18",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a topic of active debate between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a number of asset managers, notably the massive investment firm BlackRock. This action may be a crucial turning point in the acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial markets. Chair Gary Gensler's office representatives attended a recent round of discussions conducted by the SEC with asset managers who were considering the creation of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. Representatives from BlackRock met with the SEC on December 14th to discuss a proposed rule change that would permit trading of the cryptocurrency investment vehicle on major exchanges. According to reports, BlackRock and the SEC are meeting for the third time to discuss the ETF application. In recent weeks, asset managers and the SEC have had more intense talks. In addition to BlackRock, the SEC has spoken with representatives from Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity, among other significant companies. A variety of issues have been discussed in these talks, such as investor protection and market manipulation. However, special attention has been paid to the processes involved in creating currency, redeeming it, and obtaining spot Bitcoin from actual exchanges. In the financial community, the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is much awaited. Several major asset managers, including Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco, and WisdomTree, want to introduce their spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ability to trade Bitcoin on Wall Street's key exchanges would enable the cryptocurrency to reach a wider range of investors and greatly increase its credibility and acceptability in traditional finance, should the SEC approve these ETFs. However, there is a feeling of uncertainty over the result since the SEC's approach to these products has been characterized by delays and denials in the past. Differentiating between a spot and a futures Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is crucial. A spot ETF holds actual Bitcoin at the current price, indicating its real-time tracking of the price. As opposed to owning the cryptocurrency itself, a futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) makes investments in Bitcoin futures contracts, gambling on the price of Bitcoin in the future. In 2021, the SEC authorized the first Bitcoin ETF with futures. The interaction between BlackRock and the SEC has been very significant. BlackRock offered two possible redemption scenarios for its iShares Bitcoin Trust in an SEC memo: one that included in-kind transactions and the other that used cash. This demonstrates BlackRock's dedication to negotiating the regulatory environment and providing a workable Bitcoin ETF solution. There is growing conjecture that the SEC is getting closer to deciding whether to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Given its potential to have a major influence on the market, investors and the cryptocurrency sector are eagerly watching the results of these discussions. The fact that Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Valkyrie, VanEck, and Bitwise are among the other noteworthy candidates for spot crypto ETFs demonstrates the broad interest in this financial product. The continuing debate for a spot Bitcoin ETF between the SEC and big asset managers like BlackRock is a significant turning point in the development of cryptocurrencies as a mainstream commodity. The SEC's ruling, which is anticipated soon, has the potential to change the bitcoin investment environment and provide new opportunities for investor involvement in the digital asset market.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-15",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Goldman Sachs, a leading global investment banking firm, has projected a substantial surge in trading volumes of blockchain-based assets in the next one or two years, with significant market growth anticipated in three to five years, according to an interview with Reuters. This forecast, as revealed in a recent Reuters interview with Mathew McDermott, the bank's global head of digital assets, aligns with the growing interest in digital assets and blockchain technology observed across the financial sector. Goldman Sachs' enthusiasm for blockchain extends beyond traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has already seen a 50% rise in value this quarter. McDermott emphasized the firm\u2019s interest in developing digital assets that represent traditional assets such as bonds, marking a shift towards diversifying blockchain applications. This approach reflects a broader trend in the banking sector, where institutions are exploring the use of blockchain for asset trading beyond cryptocurrencies. The adoption of blockchain technology is expected to revolutionize financial market operations. According to McDermott, blockchain could enhance operational and settlement efficiencies and contribute to the de-risking of financial markets. He suggested that blockchain implementation could lead to quicker and more precise transfers of collateral and liquidity between parties, a significant improvement over current financial market infrastructure. Despite these optimistic projections, McDermott acknowledged the challenges involved in fully integrating blockchain technology into the majority of financial markets. While there have been pilot projects for issuing blockchain-based versions of bonds, establishing routine issuance and a liquid secondary market remains a work in progress. Goldman Sachs' survey indicates that 16% of clients expect over 10% of the financial market to be tokenized in the next three to five years. Goldman Sachs is also focusing on cryptocurrency derivatives trading, a market expected to grow with the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. securities regulator. This move could attract new institutional investors to the asset class, further fueling the expansion of blockchain-based trading. Goldman Sachs' prediction of a significant uptick in blockchain asset trading volumes reflects a transformative shift in the financial markets. With a growing appetite for digital assets and blockchain technology's potential to streamline operations, the coming years could witness a radical change in how assets are traded globally.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Invesco and Galaxy Digital have proposed a spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently extended the period for making a decision about whether or not to approve or disapprove of the proposal. It is clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will continue to exercise caution with regard to financial products that are based on cryptocurrencies. On the Cboe BZX Exchange, the proposal in issue calls for the listing of shares of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF and the trading of such shares. Should it be authorized, this exchange-traded fund (ETF) would be among the very first of its type. It would provide investors with the opportunity to obtain exposure to Ether, the cryptocurrency that is responsible for powering the Ethereum blockchain, via a regulated financial instrument. In the beginning, it was anticipated that the SEC would reach a ruling by the 23rd of December in 2023. However, in a notification that was sent on December 13, the Commission declared that it would need further time to consider the plan. As a result, the deadline was extended to February 6, 2024. The SEC is now able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effects that such a financial product would have on the market and the protection of investors thanks to this extension. The resolution to prolong the assessment time brings to light the continuing discussions that the Securities and Exchange Commission is having over the incorporation of cryptocurrency products into the conventional financial system. Although the cryptocurrency community is anxious for such products, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a cautious attitude because it is concerned about market volatility, regulatory compliance, and investor protection in the cryptocurrency sector, which is relatively young and is always growing. When it comes to the acceptability of cryptocurrencies by the general public, the establishment of an Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) would be a big milestone. It would give investors with a regulated and perhaps less hazardous channel to obtain exposure to Ethereum, which is not simply a cryptocurrency but also a platform for decentralized apps and smart contracts. This would be something that investors could take advantage of. Following the announcement that the deadline for the SEC's judgment on the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF has been set for the beginning of 2024, market players and cryptocurrency aficionados are keeping a careful eye on this development. It is quite probable that the conclusion will have significant repercussions for the future of cryptocurrency investments as well as the wider use of blockchain technology in the financial sector.

        "detailedArticleContent": "One of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges situated in the United States, Coinbase, has just announced a considerable increase of its service offerings. It is also important to note that this expansion is geared towards institutional investors located outside of the United States, since they now have access to spot cryptocurrency trading services on the Coinbase International Exchange. In the beginning, the service, which was launched on December 14, 2023, let users to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) against USD Coin (USDC). As a strategic reaction to the ever-changing and unclear regulatory environment in the United States, Coinbase has made the choice to create spot markets in countries other than the United States. A number of asset issuers and members of the cryptocurrency community have shown reluctance to interact with exchanges in the United States as a result of this uncertainty. The new service is intended to meet the specific requirements and expectations of Coinbase's worldwide user base by providing a spot market that is reliable and does not violate any regulations in the United States. Several stages will be involved in the introduction of spot trading on the Coinbase International Exchange, as well as its further growth. In the beginning, the service is exclusively accessible to institutional customers located outside of the United States via API access. Before beginning to grow the business, Coinbase intends to carefully construct a solid basis and gradually increase the amount of liquidity. The platform will be expanded in the next months to include retail customers, other assets, and features that allow new trading techniques and boost capital efficiency. These enhancements will be made possible by the product's expansion. The fact that Coinbase was able to get registration to operate in Spain and Singapore earlier in the year is evidence of the company's dedication to expanding itself around the world. There was a total of $10 billion worth of perpetual futures volume exchanged in the most recent quarter, indicating that the international derivatives exchange that the business operates out of Bermuda has already shown tremendous growth. On the other hand, the firm is now engaged in a legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about charges that it operates as an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer for certain crypto assets.

        "detailedArticleContent": "It is believed that El Salvador will debut its much-awaited Bitcoin \"Volcano Bonds\" at the beginning of 2024. El Salvador is a pioneering country in the use of cryptocurrencies. This action comes after the government made a pioneering decision to accept Bitcoin as legal cash, and it is a key milestone in the country's continuing acceptance of digital currency. The \"Volcano Bonds,\" which have been legally sanctioned by the Digital Assets Commission of El Salvador, are intended to be brought into circulation during the first quarter of the year 2024. On December 11, the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador certified that this information was accurate. The bonds, which had been delayed since their original release, which was scheduled to take place in March 2022, have finally been able to succeed in overcoming the regulatory obstacles that were essential for their introduction. Throughout his time in office, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has been a staunch advocate of Bitcoin and the potential advantages it may bring to the nation. His commitment to incorporating Bitcoin into the nation's financial system was emphasized via the use of social media postings, which he used to confirm the impending issuing of these bonds. The Volcano Bonds are being issued with the main purpose of addressing El Salvador's national debt and financing the creation of the envisioned \"Bitcoin City.\" A significant component of El Salvador's plan to harness the power of cryptocurrencies for the purpose of fostering economic development and innovation is this ambitious endeavor. On the Bitfinex Securities Platform, which is a blockchain-based trading platform established in El Salvador, the bonds will be issued. The bonds will give a return of 6.5% annually over a period of ten years In accordance with these efforts, El Salvador has just initiated a Bitcoin mining project with the name \"Volcano Energy,\" which is worth one billion dollars and was developed in partnership with Luxor Technology. Through the use of the country's volcanic resources for the purpose of power production, this project exemplifies El Salvador's dedication to using its natural resources for the purpose of advancing technical progress and economic growth.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In the process of filing for bankruptcy, FTX, which was formerly a dominant player in the cryptocurrency exchange market, is now confronted with a formidable obstacle. A massive tax bill of twenty-four billion dollars has been issued on FTX by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States of America. This new development has the potential to greatly alter the possibilities of recovery for those who have been affected by the collapse of the exchange. Additionally, creditors and victims of FTX, who were already hurting from the collapse of the exchange, are now faced with an additional difficulty. FTX's legal team challenges the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) unjustified and exaggerated tax demand of $24 billion, which the IRS has asserted. The Federal Trade Commission (FTX) contends that if the tax bill were to be implemented, it would deplete money that ought to be distributed to the victims of the collapse of the exchange. The attorneys for the exchange emphasize the implausibility of the claim by pointing out that FTX has suffered significant losses and that it is very improbable that it would be subject to such a big tax burden to begin with. When it comes to the legal dispute between FTX and the IRS, the legality of the tax claim is at the core of the conflict. At first, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requested $44 billion, but they ultimately settled for $24 billion. FTX, which is now in the process of liquidating its assets, contends that the United States Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) proposed recovery would be detrimental to the victims of FTX since it would divert cash away from the victims' compensation. Because of this issue, FTX's attempts to pay impacted consumers are made more difficult, and the process of restitution may be delayed as a result. This circumstance exemplifies the heightened scrutiny that digital asset firms are subjected to from authorities in the United States. Following the high-profile failure of FTX in November 2022, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Justice have increased their attention to the cryptocurrency business. A change in the way that regulatory organizations in the United States are handling the cryptocurrency industry may be seen in the case of FTX, which is characterized by allegations of mismanagement and exploitation of consumer money.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "One of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, KuCoin, has achieved a large settlement with the Attorney General's Office of the state of New York. A significant step forward in the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States has been taken with the signing of this deal, which includes a payment of $22 million and a vow to suspend operations for residents of New York State. A total of twenty-two million dollars will be paid to the state of New York by KuCoin in accordance with the agreement and consent order that was submitted to the Supreme Court of New York. This total comprises payments to the Attorney General's Office totaling $5.3 million and reimbursements to New York consumers totaling $16.77 million. At issue in the settlement are allegations that KuCoin violated securities laws by selling tokens, including ether, as securities without first registering them in accordance with the applicable regulations. The action, which was brought forward by the Attorney General of New York, Letitia James, was the first time that a regulator asserted in a court of law that ether constituted a security. This ground-breaking claim reflects the constantly growing understanding of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments as well as the regulation of such cryptocurrencies. It was noted by KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu that the payment is an endorsement of the exchange's commitment to conducting operations in compliance with regulations. This decision comes at a time when the regulatory environment for bitcoin platforms throughout the world is undergoing significant change. As part of the settlement, KuCoin will remove access for users in the state of New York within a period of one hundred twenty days beginning on the day that the order went into effect. The exchange will only allow users to withdraw money during a period of thirty days, and users will have a term of ninety days within which they may withdraw cash. This move is in line with the needs of regulatory agencies and KuCoin's evolving attitude to compliance, which is a departure from the company's former stance of protecting users' privacy. Previously, KuCoin was well-known for its pro-privacy philosophy, which opposed Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) legislation. The company's primary focus was on bitcoin transactions. Since then, this policy has undergone a transformation in order to conform to the legal standards, which is a reflection of the constant conflict that exists in the Bitcoin sector between privacy and compliance.

This case highlights the growing concerns over fraudulent activities in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency and AI technologies. Scheme Operation Details The indictment alleges that Saffron and Mazzotta conspired to defraud investors through various trading programs that falsely promised high returns using an AI automated trading bot for cryptocurrency markets. Operating under various names, including Circle Society, Bitcoin Wealth Management, Omicron Trust, Mind Capital, and Cloud9Capital, the duo duped investors, misappropriating funds for extravagant personal expenses like private jets, luxury hotels, and private security guards. Creation of Fictitious Entities To further their fraudulent activities, Saffron and Mazzotta created a fictitious entity named the Federal Crypto Reserve. They induced victims to invest in their schemes and then solicited additional funds under the guise of investigating and recovering the victims' losses. Saffron, using aliases and online personas such as the Blue Wizard and Bitcoin Yoda, masked his identity during these solicitations. Obstruction and Money Laundering Charges Both individuals are accused of conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing assets, destroying evidence, and falsifying records. They allegedly employed methods like \"blockchain hopping\" and \"mixers\" or \"tumblers\" to prevent tracing of the misappropriated cryptocurrency. Charges against them include wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice, with each facing up to 20 years in prison for major counts if convicted. Notably, Saffron was previously charged by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, indicating a history of legal challenges related to his financial activities. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "VanEck, a prominent asset management company, has made a significant stride by filing its fifth amended application for a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This move, dated December 8, 2023, marks a new chapter in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. The proposed VanEck ETF is set to be listed under the ticker symbol \"HODL.\" This term, commonly used in the Bitcoin community, stands for \"hold on for dear life\" and represents a strategy where investors buy and hold onto Bitcoin without selling. This approach is in line with the popular philosophy among Bitcoin enthusiasts of weathering market volatility and holding onto their investments long-term. The choice of the \"HODL\" ticker has attracted considerable attention from market analysts. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, opines that the ticker will resonate well with those familiar with cryptocurrencies, though it might be less intuitive for traditional investors. Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, views this as a unique and unconventional approach, distinct from the more conservative choices of other firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. VanEck is not alone in its pursuit of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Several other companies, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Franklin Templeton, are also vying for approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC has not yet given a clear indication of support for these filings, it is actively engaged in discussions with these firms to address technical aspects of their proposals. VanEck anticipates SEC approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF as early as January 2024 and projects an inflow of $2.4 billion in the first quarter following approval. The move by VanEck to file an amended application for a spot Bitcoin ETF under the \"HODL\" ticker symbol represents a strategic effort to align with the ethos of the cryptocurrency community. It also underscores the growing interest and potential of Bitcoin in the mainstream investment world. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, the anticipation for SEC approval highlights the significant impact such a product could have on the cryptocurrency market.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Tether, the most renowned stablecoin issuer, has made a big step in strengthening its collaboration with regulatory organizations and law enforcement agencies. Tether has implemented a voluntary policy to freeze wallet activity linked with people who are on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List maintained by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as of the first of December. The following list contains persons and businesses that are controlled or owned by nations that have been sanctioned. Tether has recently reinforced its commitment to the fight against cybercrime in response to the rising worries around the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities such as sponsoring terrorist organizations and the trafficking of illegal drugs. A proactive effort to engage closely with worldwide regulators and law enforcement is represented by this new wallet-freezing policy, which is a complement to the security protections that are already in place. In the past, Tether has adopted a less aggressive attitude, notably as in August 2022, when it said that it would not freeze sanctioned Tornado Cash addresses unless it was told to do so by law authorities. It is believed that the implementation of this restriction was a deliberate choice made in order to prevent criminals from taking use of Tether's USDT stablecoin. Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Executive Officer of Tether, noted that the project will further improve the good application of stablecoin technology and create a safer environment for all users. In addition, the action taken by the corporation is a manifestation of its dedication to maintaining stringent safety standards and cultivating connections with regulatory organizations. According to the new policy that Tether has implemented, 41 wallets have already been locked, some of which are connected to coin-mixing services such as Tornado Cash. Notable events include the freezing of wallets that were involved in the Ronin Bridge Attack, which was suspected to have been carried out by the North Korean hacker organization Lazarus. The attack was estimated to have cost $625 million. For more information, Tether has frozen wallets that are associated with terrorist organizations in Israel and Ukraine, as well as over 225 million USDT that are tied to an international human trafficking ring that is involved in crypto romance frauds. With its most recent regulation, Tether has established a new benchmark for the cryptocurrency market, marking a significant change in the landscape of the cryptocurrency business. It indicates that the firm is prepared to work together with regulatory authorities in the fight against illicit activity. It also displays a commitment to strengthening the integrity of the cryptocurrency sector and protecting the ecosystem from being misused. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United States government recently made a significant move by removing two key provisions from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that aimed to address Anti-Money Laundering (AML) concerns in the realm of cryptocurrency. This action marks a notable shift in the government's approach to regulating digital assets. Legislative Background and Provisions The NDAA, primarily a legislation for authorizing the country's defense department expenditures, often includes various amendments. In this context, two amendments specifically targeted the oversight of cryptocurrency transactions to mitigate money laundering risks. Risk-Focused Examination System: The first provision involved the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury collaborating with banking and governmental regulators to establish a comprehensive review system for financial institutions dealing in cryptocurrencies. This system was intended to focus on risk assessment and compliance with existing AML frameworks. Combatting Anonymous Transactions: The second provision dealt with anonymous crypto asset transactions, particularly those involving crypto mixers and tumblers. It mandated a detailed report on the transaction volumes associated with sanctioned entities and the regulatory measures taken by other jurisdictions in this context. Implications of Removal It is clear that the United States government has shifted its position on strong crypto laws, particularly those linked to anti-money laundering, as seen by the elimination of these sections. This decision was made after recent discussions on concerns over the facilitation of terrorist financing and money laundering carried out by cryptocurrency. Over the course of a hearing that took place on November 15, the Financial Services Committee of the United States House of Representatives discussed unlawful actions that take place inside the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These activities included the role that exchanges and decentralized finance providers play in combating money laundering and terrorist funding. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022 and the Responsible Financial Innovation Act were the initial sources of inspiration for the modifications. These pieces of legislation were drafted with the intention of establishing safeguards against occurrences in the cryptocurrency business that are comparable to the collapse of FTX. These were put up by a group of senators, which included Cynthia Lummis, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Roger Marshall, among others. Taking these anti-money laundering measures linked to cryptocurrencies out of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) highlights the continuing dispute and complexity surrounding bitcoin legislation. Despite the fact that it demonstrates a more circumspect attitude by the United States government in terms of placing stringent rules on the cryptocurrency industry, it also raises issues over the future direction of anti-money laundering efforts in the digital asset area.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-08",
        "detailedArticleContent": "ZachXBT, a renowned cryptocurrency detective, has shared an analysis of a unique and unconventional use of significant cryptocurrency funds. According to his investigation, an unidentified individual withdrew over 11,200 ETH, valued at around $25 million, from Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency tumbler known for its privacy features. This large sum of money was primarily used to purchase Magic The Gathering (MTG) trading cards, a popular collectible and competitive card game. ZachXBT meticulously traced the flow of these funds, revealing a complex process involving multiple steps. The individual involved first withdrew the ETH in batches of 100 from Tornado Cash to a total of 11 different addresses. Following this, the ETH was converted to Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), which was then transferred to new addresses. The WETH was subsequently unwrapped back into ETH and converted into USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This USDC was then used to facilitate transactions with an MTG broker. The identification of the MTG broker was a critical part of ZachXBT's investigation. He discovered the broker's involvement through cross-referencing usernames on Instagram and OpenSea, a popular platform for trading digital collectibles. Further inquiries into the broker's on-chain interactions with MTG sellers provided additional clarity. Interestingly, the buyer's behavior in these transactions was notable for several reasons. The individual appeared to be overpaying for the MTG items by about 5-10%, and the payments were made upfront in cryptocurrency. Despite these large transactions, the buyer's identity remained unknown to the sellers. The investigation also revealed that the funds were distributed to various deposit addresses associated with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken, Bitpay, and Coinbase. This aspect of the investigation suggests a broader network of financial activities and raises questions about the origin and ultimate destination of these substantial funds. ZachXBT's analysis does not conclusively establish the source of the funds. However, he considers the possibility that they could have originated from top Tornado Cash depositors such as Anubis, Cashio, and Uranium. This speculation is based on the timing and magnitude of their activities in relation to the withdrawal and spending patterns observed. This case stands out for its unusual combination of large-scale cryptocurrency transactions and the world of collectible trading cards. The considerable amount spent on MTG cards, along with the sophisticated methods used to mask the money trail, highlights the diverse and sometimes unexpected ways in which cryptocurrency can be utilized. It also underscores the ongoing challenges in tracking and understanding the flow of digital currencies, especially in cases where privacy tools like Tornado Cash are used. The case continues to garner interest as it sheds light on the complex and often opaque nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Image source: Shutterstock"

Animoca Brands made over seventy investments in 2023, and Yat Siu anticipates that these expenditures will result in favorable outcomes in the following year. The firm is in a position to capitalize on a variety of developing possibilities in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries thanks to its aggressive investment approach. Among the many noteworthy partnerships, one that sticks out is the one with the blockchain known as The Open Network (TON), which was revealed on November 28. As part of the validator agreement, this collaboration required the purchase of a quantity of Toncoin that was not revealed and the subsequent staking of that amount. Siu considers this agreement to be a big step toward broad onboarding and GameFi acceptance, particularly in light of the fact that Telegram has 800 million users enrolled now. The purchase of the social casual gaming platform Gamee by Animoca in July of 2020 was another key step made by the digital entertainment company. Gamee's business viability is expected to improve as a result of its integration with Telegram, which now makes it possible to monetize games. This connection makes use of the latest integration that TON has implemented, which makes it easier to display advertisements and make in-app payments on Telegram. The resurgence of the NFT market, which is being driven by long-term holders who appreciate the fundamentals and projects that lie under the surface, was another topic that Siu discussed. This rebound indicates that neither metaverse projects nor non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will have a difficult time in the future. The optimistic prognosis that Siu has for the year 2024 is supported by a number of macro variables, which Siu cites as some of the reasons that influence positive sentiment. Among them are the rising expectation around Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the United States, the conclusion of legal concerns like as the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, and the major deal that Binance reached with American authorities. As a result of these changes, Siu believes that the bitcoin industry will be in a much more stable and transparent environment in the year 2024. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-07",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A substantial warning has been issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong against two cryptocurrency firms, namely Hong Kong Digital Research Institute (commonly known as HongKongDAO) and BitCuped, both of which are accused of engaging in fraudulent operations. In conjunction with the Hong Kong Police Force, the Special Frontiers Command (SFC) has taken the initiative to restrict access to the websites of the aforementioned companies. In order to protect investors and prevent any possible investment frauds from occurring, this urgent measure has been taken. During the course of the investigation into HongKongDAO, it was discovered that the company may have been spreading misleading material on the internet. This information may have included false claims that it had obtained licenses and authority to engage in activities that are regulated. It was especially troubling that HongKongDAO was promoting the HKD token since it seemed to be an effort to lure investors under the pretext of a real opportunity. For this reason, the advertising was extremely concerning. It was found that the website of BitCuped included major misrepresentations, including the misleading assertion that it was affiliated with top Hong Kong authorities Laura Cha and Nicholas Aguzin. It was determined that the information that was provided about their executive responsibilities was very misleading and had the potential to mislead prospective investors about the authenticity and validity of BitCuped Corporation. In addition to these two companies, the SFC has issued a warning that encompasses additional platforms that are used for trading virtual assets. In addition, organizations such as JPEX and Hounax have been recognized as possible dangers since they have been disseminating misleading information on their credentials and business partnerships. In order to prevent consumers from falling victim to fraudulent schemes, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) encourages the general public to exercise caution while considering online investment possibilities, particularly those that are advertised via social media and messaging platforms. This new step is in line with the statement that the SFC made some months ago in October on changes to its rules addressing the sales of digital currency and the criteria for its use. By June 2024, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will require all exchanges that are functioning inside Hong Kong to get a license to operate as a virtual asset service provider. As part of the regulator's efforts to improve consumer protection and provide a more safe environment for cryptocurrency transactions, this measure is being taken. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "An investigation into the possibility of establishing bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is now being conducted by Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), which is in the exploratory phase. The use of digital assets inside regulated financial markets is becoming more popular throughout the world, and this move is in line with that trend. In other areas, like as the United States, Canada, and Australia, where such products are already trading on local exchanges, the Financial Stability Commission (FSC) is keeping an eye on the growth of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Financial Stability Council (FSC) has acknowledged the severe volatility that is inherent with cryptocurrencies, which is the catalyst for this cautious approach. Before taking into consideration any kind of regulation relaxation, the commission intends to finish doing extensive study and analysis on international cryptocurrency futures products and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While highlighting the need of self-regulation and standards in the early stages, the Financial Stability Council (FSC) has signalled that there would be a progressive liberalisation of restrictions for trading digital assets. This strategy is consistent with Taiwan's long-standing policy of exercising caution with respect to investment products that are prone to volatility and speculation. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has recently produced guidelines for virtual asset service providers and has been participating in the process of drafting legislation with the intention of establishing a more organised framework for the digital asset business in Taiwan. Such developments are examples of recent regulatory advancements. A growing number of exchanges all around the globe are selling cryptocurrency futures products and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which indicates that the cryptocurrency market is increasing on a global scale. The Federal Securities Commission acknowledges the possible influence of worldwide trends such as the evaluation of the Bitcoin spot ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the projected decrease in Bitcoin production in April 2023. These global movements are contributing reasons to the increase in the value of Bitcoin this year. Domestic investment banks are shown a strong interest in offering comparable financial products at a time when Taiwan is considering entering the market for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that deal in cryptocurrencies. The Federal Securities Commission is also investigating the idea of \"cryptocurrency concept ETFs,\" which would concentrate on investments in businesses that are associated with cryptocurrency software and hardware rather than directly relating to changes in the price of cryptocurrencies that are being traded. The cautious but forward-looking posture that Taiwan has taken towards exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies indicates a balance between the need for a solid regulatory framework and the global financial changes that are occurring. The exploratory phase of the Financial Stability Council (FSC) is a crucial step towards possibly increasing Taiwan's financial market services while simultaneously ensuring financial stability and protecting investors.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-05",
        "detailedArticleContent": "South Korean financial officials issued a directive on December 4, 2023, requesting users to report any unregistered cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the area. This directive was made in an effort to control the market. This approach is a reflection of South Korea's continuous attempts to simplify its digital asset market and protect investors from the possible hazards connected with virtual asset exchanges that are not regulated. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of South Korea, in conjunction with the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA), was the driving force behind this effort. A crucial part of the regulatory system is played by the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA), which is comprised of the five most important digital asset exchanges in South Korea: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. Within the scope of their combined efforts, they want to identify local as well as international virtual asset company operators who may be targeting Korean people, which might be considered a violation of Article 7 of the Specific Financial Information Act. DAXA is the organization that first investigates reports of illicit business operations carried out by bitcoin exchanges. After the results have been compiled, they are sent to the FIU, which is responsible for determining the operator's status and deciding what steps are required. If it is discovered that operators are continuing their operations that have not been disclosed, the Federal Investigation Unit intends to involve investigative authorities and take the necessary actions. The public is strongly urged to report these businesses using the tip email provided by DAXA. The information that is sent should include pertinent corporate information, grounds for suspicion, and proof of actions that have not been reported. South Korea is making a wider push to boost its engagement in the cryptocurrency business, and this new development is a part of that larger endeavor. As part of an effort to promote openness, the Democratic Party of South Korea has demanded that candidates for parliamentary seats reveal their personal cryptocurrency holdings. In addition, the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) made an announcement in October that it was making preparations for laws that would augment the Virtual Asset Users Protection Act that had been approved earlier in 2023. It is anticipated that these laws will be in effect by January 2024, which will represent a major milestone in the manner in which the nation approaches the regulation of cryptocurrencies. In order to show its dedication to the development of a secure and regulated digital asset market, South Korea has taken a position on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. The nation's goal is to safeguard investors and preserve the integrity of its financial system at the same time by carefully monitoring and taking action against cryptocurrency exchanges that do not have legitimate licenses.

        "creationDate": "2023-12-05",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A Step Into the Cryptocurrency Market The biggest private bank in Brazil, Itaú Unibanco, has just made a substantial entry into the bitcoin industry. In a significant step toward the integration of conventional banking with digital assets, the bank introduced a cryptocurrency trading service on December 4, 2023. This event marked a significant milestone. This action is a response to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies from organizations and people with high net worth all around the globe. Offerings Made Initially and Plans for the Future Trading in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two most significant cryptocurrencies, is initially available via the site. Guto Antunes, who is the head of digital assets at Itaú Unibanco, said that this is only the beginning, and he indicated that there are plans to extend to additional crypto assets in the future. This policy is in line with the changing regulatory environment as it pertains to cryptocurrencies in Brazil. The Environment of Regulation The clarity of the regulatory environment in Brazil was a significant factor in the bank's decision to provide services related to cryptocurrency trading. The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) will be in charge of supervising assets that are classified as \"securities,\" while the Central Bank of Brazil will be in charge of overseeing crypto laws. Since July 2022, this legal framework has been under review, which has provided a strong platform for financial institutions such as Itaú Unibanco to go into the realm of crypto services. The Landscape of Competition The arrival of Itaú Unibanco into the cryptocurrency trading market positions it to compete with other local firms such as the cryptocurrency exchange MB and the digital assets subsidiary Mynt of the investment bank BTG Pactual. Itaú, on the other hand, is attempting to distinguish itself by providing crypto custody services, which are aimed at protecting the assets of its consumers. The one-of-a-kind strategy that it takes places it in a favorable position in comparison to global titans such as Binance. The Currency Exchange Market in Brazil In the year 2023, Brazil had around 37.72 million users of cryptocurrencies, making it a sizable user base. In accordance with Statista's projections, this number is anticipated to increase to 54.46 million by 2020. It is obvious from these statistics that Brazilians are showing an increasing interest in cryptocurrency, which indicates that the market for Itaú Unibanco's new initiative is likely to be quite lucrative. Final Thoughts The entry of Itaú Unibanco into the cryptocurrency market is a significant event that serves as a symbol of the growing awareness and acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the mainstream financial sector. The bank is well positioned to become a significant participant in Brazil's rapidly developing cryptocurrency market because to its all-encompassing strategy, which includes securities trading and custody services.

        "articleSummary": "North Korea has escalated cyber attacks on cryptocurrency since 2017, stealing over $3 billion and stealing $1.7 billion in 2022, posing a serious threat to the country's economy and military budget.",
        "creationDate": "2023-12-04",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In recent years, North Korea has notably intensified its cyber operations, particularly targeting the cryptocurrency industry. This strategic shift emerged around 2017 when the country's cybercriminal activities, previously focused on traditional financial institutions, pivoted towards the burgeoning field of digital currencies. The impetus for this change was likely due to the increased scrutiny and enhanced cybersecurity measures adopted by banks and financial institutions following a series of high-profile heists, including the infamous Bangladesh Bank robbery, according to Recorded Future. Cryptocurrency, being a relatively new and less regulated industry, presented a lucrative and vulnerable target. North Korean operatives, leveraging their state-supported cyber capabilities, have since been implicated in a series of sophisticated attacks on various cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms globally. By 2022, their efforts culminated in the theft of an estimated $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency. This figure is staggering, not only in its sheer size but also in its economic significance to North Korea. It represents a substantial portion of the nation's GDP and a significant chunk of its military budget, highlighting the strategic importance of these cyber heists to the regime. The tactics employed by North Korean cyber actors mirror those used by traditional cybercriminals, including phishing, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and the deployment of advanced malware. However, the scale and sophistication of their operations are markedly enhanced by the support and resources of a nation-state. This state backing allows them to execute more ambitious and coordinated attacks than typical cybercriminal groups. In addition to stealing cryptocurrencies, North Korea has developed an intricate network for laundering these digital assets. The process often involves the use of cryptocurrency mixers and tumblers, services that obscure the origin of funds by mixing them with other transactions. This method complicates the task of tracing the stolen funds back to their illicit source. North Korean operatives have also been known to use stolen identities and fabricated documents to set up accounts on legitimate exchanges, further obfuscating their trail. This pattern of cybercrime has significant implications not only for the cryptocurrency industry but also for the broader global financial system. The success of North Korea's operations demonstrates the vulnerabilities that still exist in the digital financial world. It underscores the need for stronger regulatory frameworks and more robust cybersecurity measures across the industry. Moreover, the use of stolen cryptocurrency to fund North Korea's military ambitions, particularly its ballistic missile program, raises concerns at an international level. The regime's ability to circumvent economic sanctions through cyber theft highlights the challenges faced by the global community in curbing North Korea's military developments. In response to this growing threat, experts suggest several mitigative strategies. Strengthening cybersecurity infrastructure, employing multi-factor authentication, training employees to recognize and respond to phishing attempts, and using hardware wallets for cryptocurrency storage are some recommended measures. Vigilance and caution in verifying the legitimacy of transactions and the sources of funds are also crucial in combating these sophisticated cyber operations. As North Korea continues to refine its cyber capabilities and strategies, the need for a concerted and proactive response from the cryptocurrency industry and international regulatory bodies becomes increasingly urgent. The ongoing evolution of these cyber threats necessitates constant vigilance and adaptation to ensure the security and integrity of the global financial system. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-12-04",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Ethereum team leader, Péter Szilágyi, recently expressed his dissatisfaction regarding his alma mater's apparent disinterest in providing students with opportunities to engage with Ethereum technology. Szilágyi's frustration was articulated through a series of tweets on December 3, 2023, where he recounted his efforts to foster genuine interest in Ethereum at his former university. Szilágyi's attempts to spark enthusiasm included organizing a grant that allowed nine students to attend Devconnect, with all expenses paid. Despite this, he found that the students were unaware of the grant's source and showed little curiosity about it. His further efforts to initiate collaboration between students and industry professionals through university contacts also met with no response. This lack of engagement from the university and students led Szilágyi to reflect on his own university experience, where there was a constant call for industry projects and funding, yet a noticeable lack of initiative to seize such opportunities. Meanwhile, Ethereum's price has seen a significant increase, with a 20.10 percent rise over the past month, reaching a current value of $1,698.72. This growth contrasts sharply with the tepid response from academic institutions to the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Contrarily, there's an evident rise in demand for cryptocurrency and blockchain courses in educational settings globally. Large corporations drive this need, seeking professionals well-versed in blockchain technology. Companies like Oracle, Amazon, and Google are scouting for talent in this domain to develop blockchain-based solutions. Additionally, there's an increasing interest among information systems students to learn about decentralized applications. In a recent development underscoring this trend, France announced the establishment of the Institute of Crypto-Assets. This institution aims to conduct research and offer support in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, signaling a growing recognition of these fields' importance in the contemporary digital landscape.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-30",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The revenues of Dunamu, the parent company of Upbit, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, dropped by an astounding 81% during the third quarter of 2023, according to the company's report. The performance of the corporation during the same quarter of the previous year stands in striking contrast to this dramatic fall made by the company. Dunamu had reported a net profit of 159.9 billion KRW (about $123 million) in the third quarter of 2022, but this number dropped to only 29.5 billion KRW (roughly $23 million) in the third quarter of 2023. The recent decline in the cryptocurrency market is the primary cause of the financial performance of Dunamu, which has seen a large decline overall. It was admitted by the corporation that the falling pricing of digital assets, in conjunction with an investment climate that was typically slow, were important factors to this collapse. It is important to note that the issues that many organizations in the bitcoin industry had during this time period are reflected in this larger economic situation. Dunamu continues to be dedicated to the blockchain and cryptocurrency field, despite the present bear market and the financial hardships that its investors have experienced. The organization is of the opinion that increasing the number of people who use blockchain services is essential in order to successfully navigate current challenging market circumstances. As a component of their long-term plan, there is a significant emphasis placed on reviving the blockchain ecosystem and enhancing the broader investment environment. An further obstacle that Upbit, Dunamu's cryptocurrency exchange, had to contend with was a considerable rise in the number of attempts to hack the system. In comparison to the same time period in 2022, the number of hacking attempts that were made against Upbit increased by 117% during the first half of 2023. Nevertheless, it is significant that the platform has been able to prevent any big security breaches since the hacking incident that occurred in 2019 and included fifty million dollars that occurred.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-29",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Jump Crypto Holdings has been allowed to submit papers in a secret manner, which is a key milestone in the litigation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is pursuing against Terraform Labs and its creator, Do Kwon. In the current legal procedures, this action, which was approved by Federal Judge Jed Rakoff, represents a significant turning point throughout the proceedings. Considering the sensitivity and complexity of the matter, the papers in issue have been submitted to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as part of the discovery process. These materials will be processed in a private manner with the intention of protecting their confidentiality. The cryptocurrency known as Jump Crypto, which is a subsidiary of Jump Trading, is now being investigated for its alleged role in the events that led to the devaluation of the TerraUSD (UST) and the subsequent collapse of the Terra ecosystem. This event was a significant contributor to the decline in the cryptocurrency market in 2022. The manipulation of the price of UST is one of the allegations that have been made against Jump Crypto. According to the allegations, this manipulation resulted in around $1.3 billion in profits for the company and its CEO, Kanav Kariya. The gravity of the problem and the high stakes involved are supported by these claims, which are an essential component of the lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Over the course of many months, the proceedings in the case against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon have been developing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Terraform Labs and Kwon in February, accusing them of conducting a crypto asset securities scam that was worth several billions of dollars. In the context of a larger regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency companies and their executives, this case represents a component of that crackdown. Furthermore, Kwon himself has been subjected to legal issues, such as his detention in Montenegro for using forged travel credentials and the ensuing four-month jail term that he received as a result of his arrest. It was recently decided by a court in Montenegro that Kwon should be extradited, which means that he may be brought before a court in either the United States of America or South Korea to face charges. Within the context of any future motion practice or trial, the court has maintained the authority to decide whether or not to make any of the private papers available to the public. In the event that such a disclosure is being considered, the court will inform Jump Crypto's legal counsel, giving them the chance to oppose to the revelation. By using this method, sensitive information is protected from public exposure while still being protected from revelation to the general public in the event that the court deems it appropriate to do so.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Following the news that Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of volume, made about the delisting of the Tornado Cash (TORN) token, the value of the token witnessed a significant decline over time. It is important to note that the market value of TORN, which is the governing token for the cryptocurrency mixing protocol Tornado Cash, has seen a dramatic decline of more than fifty percent. In accordance with the information provided by CoinGecko, the collapse was particularly severe, with the value of TORN falling from around $4.00 to $1.66, which represents a reduction of 57%. This precipitous decline happened at the same time that Binance announced that it will stop accepting deposits of TORN on December 8 and would totally stop taking withdrawals after March 7, 2024. A portion of the decrease in the value of TORN may be ascribed to the penalties that were placed on Tornado Cash by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control on August 8 for allegedly supporting operations related to money laundering. This resulted in a legal prohibition that prevented those living in the United States from utilising the protocol. When Binance made the decision to delist TORN, it was affected by a number of different variables. On a regular basis, the exchange examines digital assets to make certain that they are up to the required standards. According to Binance, the delisting of TORN, along with other tokens such as BitShares (BTS), PERL.eco (PERL), and Waltonchain (WTC), was due to decreased development activity, poor liquidity and trading volume, and concerns about unethical behaviour or neglect. Other tokens to be delisted include Waltonchain (WTC), PERL.eco (PERL), and more. The date of the delisting is set for the seventh of December in the year 2023. The values of other tokens, such as Waltonchain, PERL.eco, and BitShares, also saw significant drops, with falls of 56%, 54%, and 47%, respectively. This is an important development. As a result of this decision, Binance recently reached a settlement with the authorities in the United States that was worth $4.3 billion. Additionally, the company experienced a shift in its leadership, with the previous CEO Changpeng Zhao resigning from his position. Binance's decision to remove Tornado Cash from its list of cryptocurrencies and the following decline in the token's value are two examples that illustrate the substantial influence that exchange choices have on cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, it is a reflection of the continued regulatory problems that the cryptocurrency sector is experiencing, as well as the critical role that compliance plays in preserving the integrity of the market.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Hive Digital Technologies, a prominent player in cryptocurrency mining, has recently announced a significant expansion of its global operations. The company's latest move involves the acquisition of a new property and data center in Boden, Sweden. This acquisition is set to enhance Hive's Bitcoin production capabilities significantly. The newly acquired property, previously part of the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 project, marks a substantial step in Hive's expansion strategy. The company entered a property transfer agreement with Turis AB, underlining its commitment to fortify its presence in the cryptocurrency mining landscape. This strategic location in Sweden, positioned near Hive\u2019s existing data center, is poised to become a key asset in the company's portfolio. Consistent with Hive's dedication to environmental sustainability, the new data center in Sweden will adhere to the company's green energy practices. Johanna Thornblad, Hive's country president for Sweden, highlighted this expansion as a testament to Hive's commitment to environmental responsibility and energy efficiency. The facility is expected to house the next generation of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) servers, a crucial component in enhancing Bitcoin production. In a strategic shift earlier this year, Hive Digital Technologies rebranded itself by dropping the term \u201Cblockchain\u201D from its official name. This move signifies the company's evolving focus towards financial opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and graphics processing units (GPUs). Despite the emphasis on AI, Hive remains deeply involved in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining, with its leadership affirming the synergistic coexistence of blockchain and AI as pillars of Web3. Hive Digital Technologies' acquisition of the data center in Boden, Sweden, represents a significant milestone in its global expansion strategy. By leveraging its commitment to green energy and innovative practices, Hive is poised to enhance its Bitcoin production while contributing to the sustainable growth of the cryptocurrency industry. The acquisition aligns with Hive's broader industry initiatives. Earlier, Hive participated in launching the Digital Power Network (DPN), which underscores the importance of proof-of-work (PoW) mining in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Furthermore, the company plans to use its 38,000 Nvidia GPUs to offer more efficient alternatives for small and medium-sized businesses, highlighting its diversification and adaptability in the evolving digital landscape.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-27",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has announced a significant breakthrough in a complex financial fraud investigation involving Patricia Technologies Limited. On November 23, 2023, the Force Public Relations Officer, ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, detailed the arrest of politician Wilfred Bonse in connection with a security breach and financial fraud at Patricia Technologies. According to the NPF, the case revolves around criminal conspiracy, unauthorized computer and network data modification, and the illicit diversion of over 200 million Naira (approximately $246,153). The investigation led to the arrest of Wilfred Bonse, accused of laundering 50 million Naira ($61,538) from a total of 607 million Naira ($747,076) fraudulently diverted from Patricia Technologies. This diversion was facilitated through a cryptocurrency wallet. Further, on November 20, 2023, the NPF-National Cybercrime Center (NCCC) arrested Njoku Kingsley, Chigozie Okorie, and Jideofor Sejus in connection with a separate case of conspiracy, identity theft, and romance scam. This operation in the Wumba District, Apo Area of the Federal Capital Territory, highlighted the suspects\u2019 involvement in swindling victims through a fake profile named Anthony James. In another development, the NPF-NCCC successfully recovered 179,372.6 USDT in a case involving Ummukulthum Basha and Sean Andres Delacruz, a US citizen. Basha, a cryptocurrency enthusiast, suffered a loss of 20,000 USDT in a fraudulent trading scheme. Sean Andres Delacruz, initially offering assistance, was later identified as the mastermind behind the criminal act. The collaboration with KuCoin was crucial in recovering the funds and identifying Delacruz. The NPF has emphasized the importance of public vigilance, especially regarding high-yield investment programs that often turn out to be scams. They urge the public to exercise caution and report any suspicious financial activities to their e-reporting portal Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-25",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Within a recent post on social media, Richard Teng, who was recently hired as the CEO of Binance, provided reassurance to stakeholders over the exchange's commitment to maintaining its key principles. His message, which comes after a turbulent era for the corporation, is a promise of stability and a focus on the user from the company's perspective. Given the recent legal problems that have involved his predecessor, Changpeng Zhao, this promise is especially noteworthy in light of those specific occurrences. Teng's Reassurance Amidst Leadership Shift The following is a tweet from Richard Teng: \"Over the next few weeks, I will be doing a lot of talking.\" More than just interviews, events, and AMAs. Excited to meet a good number of you in the near future. One thing that should be emphasized right now is that the fundamental principles that Binance upholds will not be altered. We continue to be committed to safeguarding users and developing a platform that people really enjoy using. This comment may be seen as a strong indicator of Teng's intentions as the new CEO, which include putting an emphasis on user safety and ensuring that the platform continues to be appealing. Zhao's Departure and Legal Settlement Following Changpeng Zhao's departure as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, Teng has taken over as the head of the organization. Zhao entered a guilty plea to the anti-money laundering statutes of the United States, which resulted in one of the highest corporate fines in the history of the United States. Binance was found to have broken various laws in the United States, including neglecting to disclose suspicious transactions and being involved in ransomware profits. Zhao was the one who directed Binance to commit these violations. Financial Implications for Binance In accordance with the terms of the legal settlement, Binance is obligated to make a payment of $1.81 billion within a period of 15 months, in addition to forfeiting an extra $2.51 billion. The seriousness of the compliance challenges that Binance encountered when Zhao was in charge is shown by the considerable financial burden that was imposed on the company. Teng's Focus on Stability and Compliance Binance has reached a pivotal juncture with Teng's appointment to the position of Chief Executive Officer. According to him, a strategy move toward increased regulatory compliance and openness is shown by the fact that he places a strong emphasis on preserving key values and concentrating on user safety. The implementation of this strategy is very necessary in order to regain and preserve the confidence of users in the aftermath of the legal problems and the changes in leadership. Zhao has resigned from his position at Binance; nevertheless, he continues to have a considerable investment in the firm, which suggests that he may continue to exert some influence over its activities. Due to this particular element, doubts are raised over the future course of Binance and the manner in which Teng's leadership will handle these problems. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-24",
        "detailedArticleContent": "As of late, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has adopted a resolute position against Binance, which is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. As the former Chief Executive Officer of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has resigned from his position after entering a guilty plea to charges that include violating anti-money laundering laws in the United States. Binance has agreed to pay penalties totaling more than $4.3 billion as part of a deal with the authorities in the United States. Among them is the personal contribution of fifty million dollars made by Zhao. This case exemplifies the dedication of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to enforce trading restrictions in the United States, especially against firms that let consumers in the United States to trade unregistered bitcoin derivatives. The Statement Released by Commissioner Caroline D. Pham A statement was issued by CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham that made it very apparent that the CFTC is unyielding in its pursuit of non-American corporations that violate trade laws in the United States. The comments that she made highlight the worldwide authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as well as its desire to uphold market integrity, regardless of the geographical location of the businesses that are engaged. It is a major hint that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) intends to expand its regulatory reach abroad, guaranteeing compliance with laws that are in place in the United States. The Influence on the Market for Cryptocurrencies The steps that were taken against Binance serve as a lesson for other cryptocurrency exchanges that are active on a worldwide scale. The CFTC is ready to take serious legal action against any firm that fails to comply with the regulations governing trading in the United States, as this indicates. The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the United States has undergone a substantial alteration as a result of this event, which is seen as a fundamental shift in the regulatory stance towards cryptocurrency exchanges. This position serves as a message to other platforms that operate in the United States marketplaces, indicating that compliance with rules imposed by the United States is vital and cannot be negotiated. As a conclusion, the actions and remarks made by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), in particular those made by Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, highlight a heightened regulatory attention on cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly those that are operating outside of the United States. This new development demonstrates a significant change in the approach that is being taken toward regulation in the cryptocurrency market in the United States. It highlights the significance of complying with trade regulations in the United States for all organizations that are involved in the sector. Cryptocurrency exchanges throughout the world are being pushed to reevaluate and tighten their compliance practices in order to align themselves with legislation in the United States as the regulatory environment continues to grow.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The recent announcement by Wallet of Satoshi (WoS) to withdraw its app from the U.S. Apple and Google app stores and cease serving U.S. customers marks a significant shift in the Bitcoin wallet landscape. This decision reflects the increasingly challenging regulatory environment in the United States, which has affected not only WoS but other crypto service providers as well. In a similar vein, GameStop, known for its video game retailing, terminated its crypto wallet service due to the uncertain regulatory climate in the U.S. Launched just a year prior, this service was integrated with Ethereum's layer-2 scaling protocol and allowed users to hold, trade crypto, and access decentralized apps. However, unspecified regulatory uncertainties, likely related to the intensified scrutiny by U.S. authorities like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, led to its discontinuation. Regulatory Pressures on Crypto The U.S. federal government has been contemplating enforcing know-your-customer (KYC) rules on unhosted or self-hosted crypto wallets. This controversial proposal by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) requires crypto exchanges to collect detailed personal information for transactions involving private wallets. The crypto industry expressed concerns over the feasibility and burden of these rules, given the nature of certain wallets and individual privacy considerations. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, also faced regulatory hurdles. The SEC sued Binance and its U.S. operator for several allegations, including artificially inflating trading volumes and mismanaging customer funds. To ensure U.S. customer assets remain within the country, Binance.US reached an agreement with the SEC, restricting access to these assets to Binance.US employees only. This agreement is part of broader regulatory crackdown efforts in the U.S. crypto industry. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-24",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The well-known fiat-crypto payment gateway Alchemy Pay has reached a noteworthy milestone when it obtained a Money Services License in the US state of Iowa. This achievement, which was declared on November 23, 2023, comes after they were successful in getting an Arkansas money transmitter license earlier. Obtaining these licenses is a significant milestone in Alchemy Pay's ambitions to increase its market presence internationally as well as evidence of its regulatory compliance. The regulatory body in charge of granting the Money Services License is the State of Iowa's Division of Banking. Businesses that transact money or exchange currencies in Iowa are required to have this license, which is currently included in the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS). For Alchemy Pay to continue operating in the money transfer and currency exchange industries, it is imperative that it uphold certain local regulatory criteria. Robert McCracken, Ecosystem Lead, underlined the need of complying with current financial rules in the United States. He sees a well-organized regulatory framework as critical to the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency payment sector. This emphasis on compliance stems from our understanding of its importance in promoting long-term success in the quickly changing crypto payment ecosystem, in addition to being a strategic decision. Established in 2017 in Singapore, Alchemy Pay functions in 173 nations and accepts various payment methods such as major credit cards and local mobile wallets. The company's successful license in numerous countries like the United States, Lithuania, Indonesia, and Canada highlights its powerful worldwide team and reinforces its position in the crypto payment market. Due to its recognition as an approved third-party service provider by Visa and Mastercard, it has trust even in the conventional payment industry. Companies like Alchemy Pay are well-positioned for expansion as long as U.S. authorities keep creating comprehensive laws for the cryptocurrency sector. They are actively working to fit with both established and developing frameworks. Their proactive strategy to securing licenses for worldwide compliance highlights their ability to adjust to regulatory changes and take advantage of emerging market possibilities. The purchase of the Iowa Money Services License by Alchemy Pay is a major step forward in the company's U.S. market strategy. This action strengthens its adherence to legal requirements and expands its capacity to provide safe payment services internationally. By consistently pursuing new licenses, Alchemy Pay is proactively establishing itself as a progressive and law-abiding participant in the global cryptocurrency payment space.

        "detailedArticleContent": "On November 22nd, 2023, Huobi HTX, previously known as Huobi Global, experienced a significant security breach. This attack led to a substantial loss, initially estimated at $13.6 million but later valued at approximately $30 million. This incident marks another in a series of cybersecurity challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and related platforms. Following the attack, Huobi HTX issued a statement to its users, reassuring them about the security of their funds. The exchange committed to fully compensating the losses incurred due to the attack, emphasizing its dedication to user fund safety. Despite the substantial loss, HTX clarified that the incident had a minimal impact on the platform's overall financial health and would not affect its normal operations. Huobi HTX announced plans to resume deposit and withdrawal services within 24 hours of the incident. In line with its commitment to security, HTX highlighted the importance of protecting user assets and information. The exchange assured the implementation of all necessary measures to prevent such incidents in the future. This incident is part of a larger pattern of security breaches affecting platforms associated with or managed by Chinese entrepreneur Justin Sun. Notably, the HTX Eco (HECO) Chain bridge, involving HTX, Tron, and BitTorrent cryptocurrency, suffered an $86.6 million loss in a separate attack. In total, HTX and other Sun-related businesses have faced four distinct hacks in the past two months, raising concerns about the robustness of their security measures. The most notable recent attack was against the Poloniex exchange on November 10th, resulting from an alleged private key breach. This incident led to a loss of $100 million, prompting an ongoing investigation to identify the root cause. A $10 million white hat reward is currently offered for the return of the funds stolen in the Poloniex exploit. Justin Sun has publicly addressed these incidents, emphasizing ongoing investigations to understand the reasons behind these hacks. He reassured that services would resume once the investigations are complete and the vulnerabilities are addressed. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-23",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On November 20, 2023, a critical meeting was held between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and representatives from BlackRock, Inc., and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. The meeting's primary focus was the discussion of the iShares Bitcoin Trust and its potential listing on Nasdaq as a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SEC's Division of Trading and Markets hosted the meeting, attended by key personnel including David Shillman, Tom McGowan, Randall Roy, Ray Lombardo, Molly Kim, Edward Cho, Sarah Schandler, and Stacia Sowerby. Representing BlackRock were Rachel Aguirre, Adithya Attawar, Shannon Ghia, Robert Mitchnick, Charles Park, Marisa Rolland, and Ben Tecmire. Additionally, Eun Ah Choi, Jonathan Cayne, Giang Bui, and Ali Doyle represented The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. BlackRock's presentation to the SEC included a detailed exposition of two potential models for the iShares Bitcoin Trust: the \"In-Kind Redemption Model\" and the \"In-Cash Redemption Model.\" These models outlined the mechanics of how the ETF could operate, focusing on the redemption process involving market makers, bitcoin custodians, and various exchanges. The In-Kind Redemption Model entails a process where the ETF issuer instructs the Bitcoin Custodian to release bitcoin to a market maker, who may then unwind the bitcoin position. This model involves various parties, including a U.S. Registered Broker\/Dealer, spot crypto exchanges, and a listing exchange. The In-Cash Redemption Model, on the other hand, involves the ETF issuer trading with the market maker to sell bitcoin for USD. This model includes additional steps involving the Bitcoin Custodian moving cash out of cold storage and the market maker delivering shares to the Transfer Agent via an Authorized Participant. The SEC's response to BlackRock's presentation and proposed models remains unclear, with no information on whether the SEC plans to approve the listing of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The approval of such an ETF would represent a major milestone in the acceptance of cryptocurrency in mainstream financial markets. This meeting comes amid ongoing reviews by the SEC of various proposals for spot crypto ETFs from several firms, including Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Valkyrie, VanEck, and Bitwise, alongside BlackRock. The push for a spot Bitcoin ETF has seen several delays and denials, creating a sense of anticipation and uncertainty in the crypto and financial markets. The SEC has also met with executives from Grayscale on the same day to discuss their proposal for a Bitcoin ETF. The meeting with BlackRock and the ongoing reviews indicate the SEC's active engagement in understanding and potentially integrating cryptocurrencies into regulated financial products. BlackRock's application to list a spot Bitcoin ETF on the Nasdaq was initially filed in June 2023. The discussion around Bitcoin ETFs has been fueled by a 2019 video of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, where he criticized the commission's \"inconsistent\" approach to Bitcoin products. The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC would be a landmark decision, potentially paving the way for wider acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream financial sector.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-22",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a complaint against Payward Inc. and Payward Ventures Inc., collectively known as Kraken, for operating their cryptocurrency trading platform without the necessary registrations. The complaint, filed in San Francisco, alleges violations dating back to September 2018. Kraken is accused of functioning as an unregistered exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency, amalgamating the roles of these entities without proper registration. This reportedly deprived investors of crucial protections, such as SEC inspection and safeguards against conflicts of interest. The SEC's complaint outlines several concerns, including Kraken\u2019s provision of a marketplace for securities transactions, effectively operating as an exchange; engaging in securities transactions for customers, thus acting as a broker; buying and selling securities for its own account, functioning as a dealer; and serving as an intermediary in settling transactions in crypto asset securities, thereby operating as a clearing agency. The complaint also alleges that Kraken's business practices, including deficient internal controls and poor recordkeeping, pose risks to customers. Notably, Kraken is accused of commingling customer funds with its own, leading to potential loss risks. Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, emphasized the agency's stance on Kraken's preference for profits over investor protection. The SEC seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits plus interest, and penalties. Earlier in February, Kraken agreed to a $30 million penalty and ceased offering crypto asset staking services. This lawsuit is part of a wider SEC crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges operating without proper registrations. Similar allegations were made against other exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. The SEC's list of unregistered securities includes tokens like ALGO, MATIC, and NEAR. Kraken's response, as expressed by CEO Dave Ripley, disputes the SEC's claims and defends their position of not listing securities. The debate continues over the SEC's approach to cryptocurrency exchanges and the absence of clear regulatory pathways. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Celsius Network LLC, a global cryptocurrency platform, is set to undergo a significant transformation following the confirmation of its Chapter 11 plan by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. This change comes after facing challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The restructuring plan initially involved creating a new company with Fahrenheit, LLC, focusing on various crypto business activities. However, the SEC's request for more information about Celsius' assets has led to a strategic pivot. Celsius is now planning to transition to a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, owned by its customers, known as Mining NewCo. Fahrenheit, an investment vehicle, had emerged as a key player in Celsius' reorganization plans. The SEC's involvement and requests for detailed information about Celsius' assets and business operations have significantly influenced the new direction. There are ongoing discussions about the management and future of Mining NewCo. Celsius had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022, revealing a $2 billion deficit in its balance sheet. The plan included returning cryptocurrencies to its customers and creating a new company focused on Bitcoin mining. This pivot to mining is a response to the regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the SEC, which has been a significant factor in shaping the company's post-bankruptcy trajectory. The confirmation of Celsius' restructuring plan marks a new chapter in the company's journey. While the company initially faced a significant deficit and regulatory challenges, the transition to a mining-only model under NewCo represents a strategic shift. This shift aims to address regulatory concerns and set a path for recovery and growth in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Celsius' focus on Bitcoin mining signifies its adaptation to the changing regulatory and business environment. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-22",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On November 21, 2023, the U.S. Justice Department announced a significant disruption in cybercrime activities, seizing nearly $9 million in Tether (USDT) from an international scam organization. This organization was involved in executing romance scams and cryptocurrency confidence scams, infamously known as \u201Cpig butchering.\u201D The scam network targeted over 70 victims across the United States, luring them with fake investment opportunities through non-existent trading platforms. Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri stated that this operation aimed at deceiving ordinary investors, leaving them with substantial financial losses. The U.S. Secret Service's thorough analysis and tracing of cryptocurrency transactions were instrumental in identifying and seizing the fraudulent funds. These funds were quickly laundered through multiple cryptocurrency addresses and exchanged across various digital currencies, a tactic known as \u201Cchain hopping.\u201D The successful seizure is a result of the collaborative efforts between the Justice Department and the U.S. Secret Service. U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey emphasized the department\u2019s commitment to justice for fraud victims, particularly in prominent cryptocurrency hubs like Silicon Valley. Special Agent in Charge Shawn Bradstreet of the USSS San Francisco Field Office reaffirmed the agency's dedication to protecting the financial security of U.S. citizens. The USSS San Francisco Field Office led the investigation, with Trial Attorney Georgiana MacDonald and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Chris Kaltsas and Galen Phillips managing the case and related forfeiture actions. Additionally, Tether\u2019s cooperation in transferring the seized assets was acknowledged by the department. Victims of cryptocurrency scams are encouraged to report incidents to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) Consumer Sentinel Network. This seizure is part of a broader effort by U.S. authorities to combat cryptocurrency-related fraud and crime. The U.S. government has previously demonstrated its capability to recover illegal funds in similar scenarios, such as the seizure of about 70,000 Bitcoins connected to the Silk Road in 2020. An October report by 21.co indicated that the U.S. government holds over $5 billion in seized cryptocurrency assets. The Justice Department's recent seizure of $9 million in Tether underscores the U.S. government\u2019s ongoing commitment to combating cyber-enabled financial fraud and protecting investors. This case serves as a cautionary tale about the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and the importance of vigilance in the digital finance landscape. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "articleSummary": "Binance names Richard Teng as CEO amid Changpeng Zhao's departure due to legal issues, signaling a new leadership era as the company navigates a DOJ probe.",
        "creationDate": "2023-11-22",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, is about to embark on a new section of its history with Richard Teng serving as its Chief Executive Officer. Changpeng Zhao, the creator of Binance, made the announcement on this consequential shift in leadership. Not only does Teng's appointment come at a vital moment for the exchange, but it also marks a new direction in the administration and strategy of the exchange. There is a striking coincidence between the selection of a new CEO and the departure of Changpeng Zhao, sometimes known as \"CZ,\" who was leaving under extraordinary circumstances. After pleading guilty to violating anti-money laundering rules in the United States, Zhao resigned from his position. A massive $4.3 billion settlement with United States authorities was reached as a result of this plea, making it one of the highest corporate fines in the history of the United States. Following closely on the heels of the conviction for fraud that was handed down to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Zhao's departure represents a major change in the world of cryptocurrencies. Binance is at a crossroads as a result of Zhao's abrupt departure from his role as CEO. According to a statement, he said that he was experiencing mental distress as a result of his decision to stand down, but he highlighted that accepting responsibility for his actions was in the best interest of both himself and the Binance community. Since at least 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been conducting an investigation against Binance and Zhao which has been going on for a considerable amount of time. In the course of the investigation, possible allegations of money laundering conspiracy and breaches of criminal penalties are being considered. Those who invest in cryptocurrencies have been anxiously anticipating the conclusion of this study since it would reduce a significant risk element that is hurting the market as a whole. As of late, there has been discussion over a resolution, with the Department of Justice apparently requesting more than four billion dollars from Binance as a component of the proposed settlement. Not only are the recent events that have taken place at Binance crucial for the firm, but they also have wider-reaching ramifications for the cryptocurrency market and the community as a whole. An already turbulent market has been further exacerbated by the departure of Zhao and the investigation into Binance that has been conducted by the Department of Justice. The eventual settlement of these legal challenges, in conjunction with the selection of a new chief executive officer, has the ability to stabilize the situation and restore trust among investors and users. Binance's freshly acquired Chief Executive Officer, Richard Teng, offers a plethora of expertise to the company. In order to successfully navigate Binance through the issues it is now facing, his experience and skills in the financial and regulatory areas might prove to be quite insightful. The cryptocurrency community will be paying careful attention to Teng's vision for the future of Binance since it may indicate a change in the way the business approaches regulatory compliance and market strategy because of the potential implications of this vision. With regard to the cryptocurrency business as a whole, the scenario involving Binance and Zhao is illustrative of a bigger trend that is characterized by heightened scrutiny by regulatory organizations. The completion of Binance's legal concerns with the Department of Justice has the potential to establish a standard for the manner in which other cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms interact with regulatory bodies. The need of complying with anti-money laundering legislation and other financial regulations inside the cryptocurrency field is brought into further focus by this situation. The cryptocurrency sector is now experiencing a key moment as a result of the leadership shift at Binance and its continuing relations with the Department of Justice. With Richard Teng taking over as CEO, the corporation is confronted with a variety of obstacles as well as possibilities. Not only will the manner in which Binance navigates this era be vital for its survival, but it will also be crucial for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, which is rapidly being scrutinized by authorities from across the world.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-21",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Bittrex Global, headquartered in Liechtenstein, has announced its decision to wind down operations. This process will begin with a cessation of all trading activities effective December 4, 2023. This announcement follows a period of regulatory challenges and legal proceedings that have impacted the company's operations. The wind-down process was detailed in an update published on the Bittrex Global website on November 20th. As per the announcement, from December 4th, the platform will restrict activities to withdrawals only, discontinuing all trading functions. Users holding U.S. dollar balances are mandated to convert these to euros or cryptocurrencies before the cessation date to enable withdrawals. This step is essential to ensure that customers can retrieve their funds from the platform. This closure announcement comes approximately nine months after Bittrex, the U.S.-based subsidiary, started winding down operations due to ongoing regulatory issues. In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Bittrex of operating as an unregistered exchange and broker. Subsequently, Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May, followed by a settlement with the SEC in August, agreeing to pay $24 million in fines and interest. Acknowledging the potential inconvenience to its customers, Bittrex Global emphasizes its commitment to a transparent and smooth transition. The company assures that all funds and tokens remain secure and accessible for withdrawal, adhering to their terms of service and applicable laws. The customer support team remains operational to assist with queries and concerns during this transition phase. Bittrex Global has also cautioned its customers against potential scams. The company reiterates that official communication will only be through its verified channels, advising customers to be vigilant and trust only emails from Bittrex's official domains. The decision by Bittrex Global to cease operations is a significant event in the crypto exchange industry, reflecting the ongoing challenges faced by such platforms in navigating complex regulatory environments. The company's strategic approach to winding down, prioritizing customer asset security and clear communication, underlines its commitment to responsible management during this transitional period.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-21",
        "detailedArticleContent": "According to Bloomberg, the United States Department of Justice is attempting to negotiate a settlement to a lengthy criminal investigation by requesting more than four billion dollars from Binance Holdings on behalf of the company. Since at least 2018, the United States Department of Justice has been conducting an investigation into Binance, which is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the international market. A significant point has been reached in the federal investigation, which covers a variety of intricate legal and regulatory problems that are associated with Binance's activities. Internal data about the company's anti-money laundering activities and contacts involving Changpeng Zhao, the company's founder, were demanded by federal prosecutors in December of the year 2020 after they were requested. Binance is now facing a number of legal difficulties in the United States, and this investigation is one of them. During the month of June, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance and Zhao, alleging that they were responsible for a complex plan to circumvent federal securities laws in the United States. Furthermore, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint against the exchange in March, accusing it of willfully evading U.S. commodities law. The lawsuit charges Binance and Zhao of running an unlawful exchange and a fake compliance programme. The action was filed against the exchange. These charges have been denied by Zhao, who referred to them as a \"incomplete recitation of the facts.\" The conclusion of these discussions is expected to have a considerable impact on the mood of investors towards cryptocurrencies, which is a market that is already suffering from investigations and accusations brought against a variety of companies and people by the government. In the midst of these difficulties, Binance has seen a significant departure of its executives and a decrease in its market share. Significant executives have left the company in the last few months. As the conversations between Binance and the Justice Department continue to progress, the chance of Changpeng Zhao being charged with a criminal offence in the United States is still a possibility. As early as the end of this month, there is a possibility that a statement may be made addressing the settlement of these problem areas. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of clarity about the particulars of the sanctions and the timing. Both Binance and the Department of Justice have abstained from making any kinds of statements on the current talks. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Lee Jeong-hoon, the former chairman of Bithumb, one of South Korea's primary cryptocurrency exchanges, faces a potential 8-year prison sentence. The Seoul High Court is expected to deliver its verdict in the appeal case on January 18, 2024. The legal battle revolves around accusations against Lee for his dealings with Kim Byung-gun, chairman of BK Group, in a potential acquisition of Bithumb. The prosecution alleges that Lee duped Kim Byung-gun out of 110 billion won (approximately $70 million) through a fraudulent agreement involving the listing of BXA tokens on the Bithumb exchange. The prosecution claims that Lee was fully aware of the challenges in listing the BXA token but deliberately withheld this information from Kim. Furthermore, they argue that Lee's restructuring plan for Bithumb aimed to profit from exchange tokens while evading financial regulations. Lee's defense team, however, challenges these allegations. They argue that inconsistencies in Kim\u2019s testimony undermine his credibility. Moreover, they assert that Lee fulfilled all obligations as a seller and extended the payment deadline upon request, only to be unexpectedly sued by Kim. The outcome of the appeal is critical, not just for Lee Jeong-hoon but also for the broader cryptocurrency industry. It is poised to set a precedent in legal disputes involving crypto exchanges and governance. Additionally, with Bithumb preparing for an IPO on the Kosdaq by 2025, the verdict will significantly influence the exchange's future and the fate of BXA tokens. The trial's decision, expected in January 2024, could lead to a reassessment of governance structures in cryptocurrency exchanges and potentially attract increased regulatory scrutiny. The legal outcome will be a pivotal moment for the industry, potentially reshaping policies and practices in cryptocurrency exchanges. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Senator Elizabeth Warren emphasized the growing danger of cryptocurrency scams targeting seniors. Steve Weisman, a cybersecurity expert, supported Warren's proposed Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, aimed at curbing these scams. Warren highlighted a shocking 350% surge in crypto investment scams targeting seniors, resulting in losses over $1 billion. The FBI reported that crypto scams led investment fraud in the United States in 2022, totaling $2.5 billion in stolen funds. Weisman, Scamicide.com Editor and Bentley University Senior Lecturer, explained seniors' susceptibility to crypto scams. He cited studies indicating a diminished skepticism in older age, making seniors more prone to fall for these scams, which often involve promises of high returns or fraudulent recovery offers. The allure of crypto for fraudsters lies in its anonymity and speed, making it challenging to track and recover funds. Weisman detailed various scam methods, including ransom demands, fake investment platforms, and AI-enhanced frauds. The anonymity of cryptocurrencies and their use in mixers complicates the tracking of fraudulent activities. Senator Warren's bipartisan legislation, endorsed by AARP and supported by 14 other Senators, aims to equip financial regulators with tools to monitor and act against suspicious crypto activities. Weisman strongly endorsed the Act, stressing the need for updated laws to keep pace with technological advancements. The media has highlighted the Act's potential to significantly reduce crypto scams. The law would bring digital assets under the same Anti-Money Laundering regulations as traditional currencies. The recent rise in crypto-related breaches and scams underscores the urgency of this legislation. Senator Warren, with increasing support from other senators, is pushing for prompt action against the rampant crypto crimes affecting the senior population. The bipartisan support for the Act signifies a united front against these growing financial threats. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has revised its guidelines on the listing and delisting of cryptocurrencies. This move aims to bolster investor protection and ensure that virtual currency businesses adhere to heightened regulatory standards. Since 2015, the NYDFS has been a pivotal regulator in the virtual currency sphere, introducing specific regulations like BitLicenses and trust company charters. The department's initial guidance on the adoption or listing of virtual currencies was released in 2020. Replacing its 2020 guidance, the NYDFS\u2019s new directive, effective immediately, introduces more stringent requirements after considering inputs from various stakeholders. The guidelines emphasize heightened consumer protection measures and clearer risk assessment procedures to reduce ambiguities in regulatory processes. Also included are exceptions for advance notifications in specific scenarios of coin delistings and updated definitions for clarity. Entities involved in virtual currency activities are now required to obtain DFS approval for their coin-listing policies, maintain detailed records, and communicate with DFS regarding self-certified coins. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the new regulations is the development of a comprehensive coin-delisting policy. Entities must formulate these policies and submit them for review, complying with the revised guidelines by January 31, 2024, while presenting their draft policies by December 8, 2023. These guidelines are set to influence a range of licensed digital currency businesses in New York. The NYDFS aims to maintain its leadership in regulating the evolving virtual currency market. The NYDFS\u2019s initiative is part of its broader efforts to protect investors in the cryptocurrency market. Entities like Circle, Gemini, Fidelity, Robinhood, and PayPal must comply with these new regulations, reflecting New York's commitment to monitoring the cryptocurrency industry closely.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-17",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A memorandum submitted by several U.S. Congress members, including chairs from key financial committees, has called into question the enforceability of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121). This development follows a decision by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) characterizing SAB 121 as a rule under the Congressional Review Act. Introduced on April 11, 2022, without consultation with major financial regulatory bodies, SAB 121 requires custodians to report customer custodial digital assets on their balance sheets, evaluated at fair value. This directive deviates from standard accounting practices, potentially misrepresenting custodians' legal and economic responsibilities and escalating consumer risk. The GAO, in October 2023, asserted that companies might alter their behaviors to align with the SEC's interpretations in the Bulletin, due to the SEC\u2019s role in monitoring public disclosures and enforcing compliance. Notably, the SEC did not submit SAB 121 to Congress or the GAO, nor did it publish it in the Congressional Record, as mandated by the Congressional Review Act. The Congressional memo highlights concerns that enforcing this noncompliant rule would create a precedent for regulatory evasion of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), effectively granting the SEC undue regulatory control over unauthorised entities. The Congress members have requested financial authorities to clarify, through guidance or action, that SAB 121 is not enforceable following the GAO\u2019s determination. SAB 121's mandate for banks to record client cryptocurrency holdings on their balance sheets, with appropriate valuation and capitalization, has drawn criticism from industry representatives and U.S. politicians. They argue that it could deter regulated banks from acting as crypto custodians and treat crypto holdings differently from traditional assets. The inquiry into SAB 121's status as a rule stemmed from Senator Cynthia Lummis's letter to the U.S. Comptroller General in August 2022. The Congressional Review Act necessitates that an agency rule be reported to both Congress and the comptroller general, with a provision for Congressional disapproval. In June 2022, five senators had already expressed opposition to what they termed \"backdoor regulation\" in a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The memorandum signifies a significant moment in the oversight of digital asset regulation, emphasizing the need for clarity and adherence to established legislative procedures.

Matthew White has been appointed as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), taking over from Henson Orser. This transition comes at a pivotal time, as Dubai intensifies its regulatory framework for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The leadership change is part of VARA's strategy as it gears up for \"full-scale market operations\" in 2023. Matthew White, with over 20 years of global advisory experience, including his role as a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), is set to take the helm of VARA. His deep expertise in technology and digital trust positions him well to lead the regulatory body through its next phase of development. Despite stepping down, Henson Orser will continue his association with VARA in a consulting capacity. Orser, a seasoned financial professional, has been instrumental in establishing a \"specialist regulatory regime\" for Dubai's cryptocurrency market, particularly following the challenges faced in the aftermath of the FTX exchange failure. This leadership transition aligns with the broader efforts of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to tighten its regulations concerning virtual assets. In a collaborative effort, multiple UAE agencies released comprehensive guidelines for VASPs on November 8, incorporating various penalties for entities operating without appropriate authorization. This move is part of the UAE's endeavor to be removed from the \"grey list\" of the Financial Action Task Force, to which it was added in 2022. As Dubai's VARA enters a critical phase in its regulatory journey, the appointment of Matthew White as CEO symbolizes a commitment to strengthening oversight and fostering a secure and robust virtual asset market. With the continued support of Henson Orser, VARA is poised to navigate the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation effectively. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has finalized the dismissal of a class action lawsuit against Tether and Bitfinex. This lawsuit, initially filed by plaintiffs Shawn Dolifka and Matthew Anderson in 2021, targeted the stablecoin issuer Tether and its affiliated company Bitfinex. The primary allegation centered on the claim that Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin was not backed one-to-one with U.S. dollars as the company had stated. The plaintiffs argued that Tether and Bitfinex did not maintain adequate reserves for the USDT in circulation, thereby misleading investors and the market. Judicial Proceedings and Outcome The case saw a decisive turn when Chief Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a comprehensive 6-page decision. This decision included an order dismissing the class action lawsuit in its entirety, citing the meritless nature of the claims. Following the denial of Dolifka\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, the plaintiffs chose not to appeal the judgment, effectively bringing the legal battle to a close. This outcome has been viewed as a significant legal victory for Tether and Bitfinex, as it upholds the dismissal of what was deemed a baseless lawsuit. Implications and Future Considerations Despite this legal victory for Tether and Bitfinex, the lawsuit highlighted ongoing concerns and controversies surrounding Tether's claims about its USDT reserves. The case has brought to light the critical need for transparency and accurate disclosure in the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for stablecoins, which play a vital role in the market. This dismissal, while affirming Tether and Bitfinex\u2019s position, also serves as a reminder of the legal and regulatory scrutiny that crypto entities can face. Image source: Shutterstock"

With its headquarters in Austin, Texas, Unchained\u2019s network now includes Bakkt, alongside Coincover and Kingdom Trust, offering an unmatched breadth in the industry for secure bitcoin storage. The inclusion of Bakkt, founded in 2018 by Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE) and renowned for its institutional-grade custody, trading, and onboarding capabilities, complements Unchained\u2019s commitment to providing secure and compliant crypto infrastructure. Bakkt Custody, operated by Bakkt Trust Company LLC and an NYDFS Qualified Custodian, adds significant credibility to Unchained's custody solutions, reinforcing client confidence in asset safety. Unchained's innovative approach to bitcoin treasury security involves a model requiring multiple private keys for access, thereby reducing risks associated with exchange hacks and self-custody challenges. Clients have the flexibility to hold a private key or distribute it among trusted custodians, including Bakkt. This method resonates with Unchained\u2019s belief that a decentralized custody solution is more robust than relying on a single custodian. Gavin Michael, CEO and President of Bakkt, highlights the critical need for qualified custody in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Bakkt\u2019s entry into Unchained\u2019s enterprise custody network is a strategic move to cater to clients seeking regulated and secure bitcoin custodians. Emphasizing security and compliance as Bakkt\u2019s core values, Michael anticipates a fruitful collaboration with Unchained. Joe Kelly, CEO and co-founder of Unchained, expresses his enthusiasm for the partnership with Bakkt, emphasizing the alignment of both companies in prioritizing client asset security. Kelly underscores the importance of providing bitcoin storage options that safeguard against single points of failure and enable clients to independently verify the safety of their assets. This collaboration follows the recent addition of Coincover to Unchained\u2019s network in October. As Unchained continues to expand its custody partnerships, it maintains a focus on empowering clients with unilateral control over private keys, a cornerstone of secure and autonomous asset management. Unchained and Bakkt are scheduled to host a joint webinar on November 16, 2023, to discuss the intricacies and advantages of collaborative custody as a risk management solution.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Crypto Coinbase has challenged the decision of the United States Treasury Department to include Tornado Cash, a decentralized software project, on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN). This action, which was brought up in the Western District of Texas, marks a serious clash between the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency industry and the federal regulatory authorities. Tornado Cash is a platform that runs on the Ethereum blockchain that offers immutable smart contracts that permit anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. This protects the users of Tornado Cash from having their privacy compromised. This piece of software has emerged as a central issue in the ongoing discussion on the appropriate level of government oversight of the digital space. According to the allegations made in the complaint filed by Coinbase, the action taken by the Treasury Department to penalize Tornado Cash goes beyond the scope of the legal power granted to it under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. The plaintiffs contend that the usual definitions of a \"national\" or \"person\" do not apply to Tornado Cash since it is a decentralized organization, and these activities are governed by those definitions. In addition, they argue that the smart contracts in issue do not qualify as \"property\" in the legal sense since they cannot be changed and no one owns them. Furthermore, they claim that Tornado Cash does not have any legal, equitable, or beneficial stake in the smart contracts in question. The judicial procedures shed light on the difficulty of governing blockchain technology and the ramifications it has for individual privacy and rights. The plaintiffs contend that the inclusion of Tornado Cash on the SDN List by the Treasury unfairly criminalizes the use of a privacy-focused software application, which impacts law-abiding persons. The plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit to challenge this designation. As the case moves forward, it exemplifies the rising contradictions between the essential need for regulatory control in the bitcoin industry and the basic rights of free speech and privacy. The verdict in this case has the potential to establish an important precedent for the future regulation of cryptocurrencies as well as the wider use of economic penalties in the era of digital technology.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Boyaa Interactive International Limited, a distinguished online card and board game developer based in Hong Kong, is advancing into the cryptocurrency realm. Since its founding in 2004 and subsequent listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2013, Boyaa has established a robust presence in the gaming industry, offering popular titles like Texas Hold\u2019em and Chinese Chess. In a significant strategic pivot, Boyaa Interactive plans to invest up to $100 million in cryptocurrencies. This decision is part of the company's broader strategy to integrate its business model with the evolving Web3 landscape. Emphasizing the importance of digital asset management, Boyaa's Board views this move as a pivotal step towards future growth and innovation in the digital economy. The Board has proposed an Acquisition Mandate, pending shareholder approval, to facilitate cryptocurrency acquisitions over the next 12 months. The focus will primarily be on acquiring mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), along with a certain allocation for stablecoins like Tether USD (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). This approach is designed to align with the company\u2019s asset allocation strategy and its push into Web3 technologies. Boyaa's financial trajectory, as evidenced by its positive annual results in both 2020 and 2022, positions it well for this venture. The company has shown a considerable increase in net profit, indicating a stable financial base to support its cryptocurrency endeavors. Despite the potential benefits, the Board acknowledges the risks associated with the volatile cryptocurrency market. Investments will be executed on regulated platforms, and the company has established a specialized supervisory team to ensure compliance and manage risks. Boyaa Interactive\u2019s move into cryptocurrency underscores a strategic alignment with current digital asset trends and the growing influence of Web3 in the gaming sector. While navigating the inherent risks of the cryptocurrency market, Boyaa\u2019s well-established financial foundation and strategic approach suggest a calculated and promising venture into the digital asset space.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-14",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Cboe Global Markets, Inc. has announced a groundbreaking development in cryptocurrency trading, according to Prnewswire. Beginning January 11, 2024, Cboe Digital will launch margin futures trading for Bitcoin and Ether. This initiative positions Cboe Digital as the first U.S.-regulated crypto native exchange and clearinghouse to offer both spot and leveraged derivatives trading on a single platform, representing a significant advancement in the integration of cryptocurrency into the broader financial market. The introduction of margin futures trading by Cboe Digital is a strategic move that combines the robustness of traditional financial market infrastructure with the burgeoning field of digital assets. This approach allows traders to engage in futures trading without the need to post full collateral upfront, thus offering greater capital efficiency compared to traditional non-margined futures trading. This margin model not only enhances capital efficiency but also marks an evolutionary step in crypto trading, catering to both institutional and individual investors. The launch is backed by a coalition of 11 leading firms from both the cryptocurrency and traditional financial sectors, including B2C2, BlockFills, CQG, Cumberland DRW, Jump Trading Group, Marex, StoneX Financial, Talos, tastytrade, Trading Technologies, and Wedbush. These partnerships reflect a strong industry support and a shared vision for advancing secure and transparent trading in digital assets.

He highlighted the importance of derivatives in providing liquidity and hedging opportunities in the crypto space. Supporting voices from the industry, including Nicola White of B2C2 and Chris Zuehlke of Cumberland DRW, also stressed the role of Cboe Digital's initiative in enhancing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and maturing the crypto asset class. Cboe Digital's expansion into Bitcoin and Ether futures trading complements its existing offerings in the spot crypto market, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin, and USDC. The platform will provide detailed margin requirements and risk management tools on its website, ensuring a comprehensive and transparent trading experience. Cboe Global Markets is renowned for delivering market infrastructure and tradable products across multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives, FX, and digital assets. Cboe Digital operates in compliance with regulatory standards set by the CFTC and is licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Looking ahead, Cboe Digital is exploring expansion into physically delivered products, contingent on regulatory approvals, signaling its commitment to innovation and growth in the digital asset space.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Coin Cloud, a participant in the cryptocurrency ATM market, has lately come under fire for a serious cybersecurity vulnerability. This episode adds to the company's already long list of difficulties, which began with its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2023. An extensive data breach at Coin Cloud has been attributed to an unidentified threat actor. The claims state that the hack led to the exfiltration of private client information from Coin Cloud's ATMs. Approximately 70,000 client selfies that were taken using ATM cameras are included in this data, along with over 300,000 customers' personally identifiable information (PII). A variety of information is included in the compromised PII, such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, complete names, email addresses, phone numbers, current jobs, physical addresses, and more. According to the threat actor, this information is relevant to people in Brazil as well as the United States. In addition, the perpetrators of the hack claim that they have taken the source code for the whole of Coin Cloud's backend. This is a development that may have far-reaching repercussions for the safety of the firm as well as its operational integrity. The recent past of Coin Cloud has been marked by a series of financial challenges, which culminated in the company's filing for bankruptcy earlier this year. It was a huge event when the corporation decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February of 2023. This indicated that the company was experiencing serious financial hardship. When taken together, this bankruptcy petition and the most recent data leak portray a picture of a firm that is struggling to cope with numerous crises. Because of the breach at Coin Cloud, major questions have been raised regarding the safety precautions taken at cryptocurrency automated teller machines (ATMs), which are a relatively new but fast increasing industry in the financial technology landscape. The loss of such a large quantity of sensitive customer data may have significant repercussions for the people who were impacted, including the possibility that their identities would be stolen and that they would become victims of financial fraud. In addition, the allegation of stealing source code adds still another level of complication to the matter. If what you say is accurate, then the whole functioning of Coin Cloud might have its security compromised, leaving it open to more assaults and opportunities for exploitation. As Coin Cloud makes its way through these trying times, the emphasis will be on how the firm reacts to this hack and what steps it takes to strengthen its cybersecurity defenses.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A significant cryptocurrency theft has been reported, involving the loss of 27 million USDT (Tether). The incident was first brought to light by a tweet from ZachXBT, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency community, known for his investigative work on crypto-related frauds and scams. According to ZachXBT's tweet, the theft occurred on November 12, 2023. The stolen USDT was rapidly converted into Ethereum (ETH) and then dispersed through various services, including FixedFloat and ChangeNow. Subsequently, the funds were bridged to Bitcoin via THORChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol. An intriguing aspect of this case is the connection of the victim's address to the Binance deployer. Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has been known for its robust security measures. The involvement of an address linked to Binance's deployer raises questions about the security protocols and the potential vulnerabilities that could have been exploited in this theft. The transaction ID provided by ZachXBT for the theft is 0x0f2183c8e415e61b4ad7774bf1097019eb2d5b85798a2a229070495131d60321. This transaction can be traced on the Ethereum blockchain, offering insights into the movement of the stolen funds. The rapid conversion of the stolen USDT to ETH and the subsequent transfer to various services highlights the challenges in tracking and recovering stolen cryptocurrency funds. The use of decentralized exchanges and cross-chain bridges like THORChain further complicates the recovery process, as these platforms often do not have the same level of regulatory oversight or user identification requirements as centralized exchanges. Recent months have seen a surge in significant crypto hacking incidents, highlighting the persistent vulnerabilities in the digital asset sector. One case was the LastPass hack in October, where hackers siphoned $4.4 million from over 25 users, underscoring the risks associated with digital security and password management. This event was closely followed by a major breach at the Poloniex exchange, resulting in a staggering loss of over $100 million in crypto assets, believed to be due to a private key compromise. In a related development, the digital asset lender Hodlnaut faced liquidation amid the crypto winter, affecting numerous users and creditors. These incidents collectively underscore the critical need for enhanced security measures and vigilance in the cryptocurrency industry, as investors and platforms alike navigate the complexities of digital asset security.

        "detailedArticleContent": "U.S. Data Mining Group, Inc., doing business as US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC), today announced two pivotal developments: the progression of its merger with Hut 8 Mining Corp (\u201CHut 8\u201D) and the court approval of the Celsius bankruptcy restructuring plan. USBTC is advancing its all-stock merger (the \u201CTransaction\u201D) with Hut 8, a leading North American digital asset mining and high-performance computing infrastructure provider. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the registration statement for the merger effective on November 9. Asher Genoot, President and Co-Founder of USBTC, expressed enthusiasm about the merger, stating, \u201CJoining forces with Hut 8 marks a new phase of growth for our shared company. This merger shows our ongoing dedication to operational excellence and provides a strengthened platform for our shared future.\u201D The merger is anticipated to be finalized by November 30, 2023, pending approval from USBTC stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Post-merger, the common stock of the new entity, Hut 8 Corp. (\u201CNew Hut\u201D), is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the proposed ticker symbol HUT. In another significant development, USBTC, alongside consortium partners Arrington Capital, Proof Group, Steve Kokinos, and Ravi Kaza, acknowledges the court's approval of the Celsius bankruptcy restructuring plan. This approval marks a crucial step for the consortium to begin managing Celsius's assets and operations. The plan received overwhelming support from creditors, with a 95% approval rate. The approved plan outlines a strategy for establishing and operating a new public, regulatory-compliant company to manage Celsius' illiquid assets. This move signifies USBTC's commitment to shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry through operational excellence and innovative solutions. USBTC, founded by visionary entrepreneurs and experienced executives, is a prominent North American mining company known for its efficiency, eco-friendliness, and large-scale operations. With campuses in New York, Nebraska, and Texas, USBTC aims to set industry standards. Recently, Hut 8 Mining Corp has received the green light from the Canadian Supreme Court for the merger with USBTC. This approval further solidifies the merger's progression and highlights Hut 8's commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX), has reached a significant milestone. The protocol's front-end fees have accumulated over $1 million, a feat achieved within just 24 days. This article delves into the details of this achievement, its implications, and the context surrounding Uniswap's revenue model. Data from Dune Analytics reveals that Uniswap's front-end fees have exceeded $1 million. This rapid accumulation of fees highlights the growing activity and user engagement on the platform. Notably, this milestone was reached in less than a month, indicating a significant surge in transactions processed by Uniswap. Following this achievement, projections for Uniswap's annualized revenue are impressive. On-chain data platform Token Terminal estimates the annualized revenue at approximately $15.2 million. This figure not only underscores the financial success of Uniswap but also reflects the robust nature of its operational model within the DeFi ecosystem. In the backdrop of this milestone, Uniswap's daily fee rate has experienced noteworthy fluctuations. There was a remarkable surge of 69.8% in the last seven days, despite a decline of 43.5% in one day. These dynamics suggest a volatile yet strong market performance and user engagement on the platform. The front-end fees contribute a substantial portion to Uniswap's total revenue. In the last 24 days, these fees accounted for 17.4% of Uniswap's total fees. This proportion highlights the significance of front-end fees in Uniswap's overall revenue model. The introduction of front-end fees by Uniswap in October sparked some controversy. The decision to implement a 0.15% exchange fee was a notable shift in the platform's approach to revenue generation. This move, while contributing significantly to Uniswap's income, also brought about discussions and debates within the DeFi community regarding the implications for users and the broader ecosystem. Uniswap's surpassing of $1 million in front-end fees in a short span signifies not only its growing prominence in the DeFi space but also the evolving dynamics of revenue generation in decentralized exchanges. As the platform continues to adapt and innovate, it remains a key player in shaping the landscape of decentralized finance. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Unprecedented Accumulation of Wealth Caused by Bitcoin In the year 2023, there was a significant shift that took place in the landscape of Bitcoin riches. The number of Bitcoin wallets that store more than $1 million has skyrocketed from 23,795 on January 1 to 81,925 at the end of the year, according to data provided by BitInfoCharts. This is an astounding growth of 237%. This spike is not simply a reflection of the desire of ordinary investors, but it also signals a fundamental change in the attitude that financial institutions have towards Bitcoin. These organizations, who were previously skeptical about cryptocurrencies, are now actively engaged in this industry because they see Bitcoin's ability to serve as both a medium for the storage of wealth and an investment opportunity that offers significant returns. The historical setting and the current state of the market The rise in the number of Bitcoin wallets owned by millionaires is not a unique phenomena. It is a reflection of a larger trend in the market for cryptocurrencies. Comparative data from Glassnode shows that the number of addresses holding more than $1 million in Bitcoin hit its all-time high of 112,573 on November 9, 2021. This figure coincides with the last bull market's apex, which occurred when Bitcoin achieved its all-time high of $69,000. Additionally, the number of wallets containing at least one Bitcoin, increased by a relatively modest 4% to reach 1,018,015 addresses, up from 978,197 at the beginning of the year. This number represents an increase from the previous year's total of 978,197. A Look at the Factors That Are Driving the Increase The increase in the number of Bitcoin millionaire wallets in 2023 was caused by a number of different variables. One of the most important factors was the general excitement of the market for Bitcoin, which was fueled by an almost 40% gain in its trading price in the previous month. The price of bitcoin went up and down between $36,800 and $37,050, indicating that investors are feeling confident and optimistic. This confidence was further encouraged by the expected acceptance of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with experts from Bloomberg estimating a high possibility of approval. Moreover, this optimism was further fueled by the approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This possible change, together with projections of a major growth in Bitcoin demand, provided a fertile ground inside the Bitcoin ecosystem for the creation of wealth. The Prognosis for the Future The fact that the number of Bitcoin millionaire wallets will triple in 2023 is indicative of a developing cryptocurrency industry, one in which Bitcoin is becoming more widely seen as a legitimate investment option by both people and institutions. This development may mark the beginning of a new age in the landscape of digital currency, one that is distinguished by more involvement from institutions and an investing climate that is more stable. As the market continues to change, it will be very important to keep track of these patterns and the consequences they have for the larger financial environment. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Supreme Court of India has recently declined to consider a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that sought to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading in India. This decision is notable as it highlights the judicial perspective on the legislative nature of cryptocurrency regulations. Key Details of the Petition and Court's Ruling The petitioner, Manu Prashant Wig, currently detained by the Delhi Police, was implicated in a 2020 cryptocurrency case. Wig, accused of defrauding investors in crypto schemes, held a directorial role at Blue Fox Motion Picture Limited. A total of 133 investors, claiming to be victims, filed a case alleging deceit by Wig. Wig filed the PIL while in custody, ostensibly seeking a regulatory framework for crypto trading in India. However, the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice D. Y. Chandrachud, determined that the PIL's true aim was to secure bail for Wig. The court advised Wig to seek legal remedies through appropriate channels and approach a different court for bail matters. The Supreme Court emphasized its inability to issue directives under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution, pointing out that the demands of the petition were more legislative than judicial. The court's decision underlines the distinction between legislative and judicial roles in forming regulations, especially in emerging sectors like cryptocurrency. Crypto Trading in India Regulatory Uncertainty: The rejection of the PIL underscores the ongoing uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency trading in India. The absence of standardized rules and specific frameworks for handling cryptocurrencies continues to create a debatable environment. Future Prospects: India is reportedly in the process of developing a cryptocurrency regulatory framework. This framework is expected to draw on recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Legal legislation pertaining to cryptocurrency regulation is anticipated within the next five to six months, which could bring much-needed clarity and structure to the sector.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The \"fixReducedOffersV1\" amendment, which is currently in its final activation countdown phase, is about to bring about a significant improvement to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which is nearing completion. This modification is a crucial upgrade for XRPL, signifying a step forward in resolving important concerns, notably within its Decentralized Exchange (DEX) services. It has received approval from more over 80% of the validators, signaling that it is ready for implementation. Taking on the Challenges of the DEX: The major objective of fixReducedOffersV1 is to lessen the impact that decreased offer prices have on the order books of trades conducted on XRPL's DEX. By ensuring that trade operations are both more visible and more efficient, the purpose of this update is to improve the overall functioning and dependability of XRPL. Enhancing Exchange Rates This modification might result in rounding the exchange rate of a lowered offer to make it more attractive than the initial offer for takers on XRPL's DEXs. This would be done in order to enhance exchange rates. This method could make it possible for additional matching offers to consume the decreased offer, which might eventually lead to trade situations that are more efficient and fair. Requirements for Upgrades In order for this amendment to be successfully implemented, it is required that more than eighty percent of updates be completed within a timeframe of fourteen days. Users that depend on previous versions of rippled, notably v1.11.0 or earlier, are recommended to upgrade their systems in order to continue successfully engaging in XRPL's ecosystem and to prevent disruptions. Taking Action Against Unfavorable Rates In the absence of this modification, bids with very little money left over have a greater chance of being awarded considerably unfavorable exchange rates after rounding, in comparison to the value they had initially. This circumstance may make it more difficult to accept offers that are more advantageous, which would create difficulties for decentralized brokerage systems based on XRPL. Update for XRPL v1.12.0: The correctionReducedOffersV1 was a component of the more extensive XRPL version 1.12.0 upgrade that was released in September. This update also includes many bug fixes and revisions relating to Automated Market Maker (AMM) and Clawback functionalities. Users were needed to upgrade to the most recent version in order to maintain uninterrupted interaction after this update, which was necessary for the ongoing progress of XRPL. favorable Outlook and Security Audits: The XRPL has undergone considerable internal and external advancements, which have contributed to its more favorable outlook. Additionally, security audits have been conducted. XRPL's prospects have been further strengthened by the conclusion of the most recent security assessment for the Xahau sidechain, which underlines the company's commitment to maintaining high levels of security and dependability.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Nearly a year after the dramatic collapse of FTX, several former executives of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange have banded together to launch a new venture in the digital currency space. This new endeavor, named Backpack Exchange, is set to reshape the crypto landscape with a focus on enhanced security and regulatory compliance. Genesis of Backpack Exchange Leadership and Vision: The project is spearheaded by Can Sun, previously a lawyer at FTX, with significant support from Armani Ferrante, a former FTX employee who now serves as CEO of Trek Labs, the holding company based in the British Virgin Islands. Trek Labs, a Dubai-based startup, has been authorized to offer cryptocurrency services in the region. Claire Zhang, Sun's former legal deputy at FTX and Ferrante's spouse, also plays a crucial role in the team, albeit with plans to step down post-investment round. Mission and Technology: With lessons learned from FTX\u2019s downfall, Backpack Exchange focuses on ensuring the security of customer funds, a critical aspect FTX failed at. The exchange incorporates a self-custody solution utilizing a multiparty computation (MPC) technique, designed for enhanced security in fund transactions. Strategic Location and Regulatory Compliance Dubai as a Crypto Hub: The choice of Dubai as the base for Backpack Exchange is strategic. Dubai\u2019s progressive stance towards virtual assets and the regulatory framework established by the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) offers a conducive environment for crypto ventures. Backpack has obtained the Dubai Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, enabling it to operate within one of the world\u2019s emerging financial centers. Product Offerings and Launch Timeline: Backpack Exchange plans to commence operations with spot trading, featuring state-of-the-art features like zero-knowledge proof of reserves and low-latency order execution. Exclusive early access is set for November 2023 for existing Backpack and MadLads community members, followed by a broader public launch in early 2024. The Road Ahead: Transparency and Market Integrity Commitment to Transparency: In a bid to instill greater trust and compliance in the crypto industry, Backpack Exchange adheres to VARA\u2019s stringent regulations. This commitment is seen as a major step towards the institutionalization of cryptocurrency trading in Dubai, enhancing investor protection and maintaining market integrity. Dubai's Regulatory Framework: The decision of Dubai to regulate and license exchanges like Backpack reflects a positive approach towards embracing blockchain technology, with a focus on creating a regulated yet thriving environment for crypto-assets.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Irina Dilkinska, the former \"Head of Legal and Compliance\" of OneCoin, has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges. This plea marks a crucial step in the ongoing investigation into the multi-billion dollar pyramid scheme that defrauded investors worldwide. OneCoin, established in 2014 by Ruja Ignatova and Karl Sebastian Greenwood, was a company based in Sofia, Bulgaria. It was marketed as a revolutionary cryptocurrency but was, in reality, a fraudulent pyramid scheme operated through a global multi-level-marketing (MLM) network. Despite being revealed as a scam in 2015, OneCoin managed to generate significant revenues, amounting to over \u20AC4 billion between 2014 and 2016. Dilkinska, the 42-year-old Bulgarian national, served as OneCoin's head of legal and compliance. Contrary to her role, she facilitated the laundering of millions of dollars of illicit profits garnered by OneCoin. Among her notable activities was the transfer of $110 million in fraudulently obtained proceeds to a Cayman Islands entity. Dilkinska pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, each carrying a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison. Her sentencing is scheduled for February 14, 2024, under the jurisdiction of U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos. The case is being prosecuted by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Ruja Ignatova, known as the \"Cryptoqueen,\" remains at large since her disappearance in 2017, shortly after a federal warrant was issued for her arrest. Ignatova was added to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List in 2022, with a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest. Co-founder Greenwood was convicted of fraud and money laundering, receiving a 20-year prison sentence and ordered to pay $300 million in restitution. The guilty plea of Irina Dilkinska in the OneCoin case underscores the extent of the fraudulent activities within the cryptocurrency scheme. With significant financial losses and global impact, the case continues to be a stark reminder of the risks associated with unregulated digital currencies. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "articleSummary": "The U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on Hamas, a Palestinian terrorist group, following their attack on Israel, focusing on their use of cryptocurrency assets. The sanctions include sanctions on officials, a Gaza-based crypto exchange, and individuals involved in Hamas' financial operations.",
        "creationDate": "2023-11-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Wally Adeyemo, the Deputy Treasury Secretary for the United States, made a recent announcement on further sanctions against Hamas, according to Reuters. These new measures are focused on Hamas' usage of bitcoin assets. This comes as a direct retaliation to the assault carried out by the Palestinian terrorist organization against Israel a month ago. The purpose of the sanctions, which were coordinated with partners of the United States, is to cut off Hamas's sources of revenue, especially those ones that include crypto assets. Specifics of the Sanctions The United States Treasury has implemented penalties on top Hamas leaders, a crypto exchange operating in Gaza, and people who have been related to Hamas's financial support. This comprises two Hamas executives as well as six persons who manage the financial portfolio for Hamas across a variety of geographic areas. The sanctions are a part of an attempt to disrupt the income that the organization derives from a portfolio of companies that is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) under the United States Department of the Treasury especially targeted the cryptocurrency exchange known as \"Buy Cash,\" which was located in Gaza and is suspected of having aided in the funding of terrorist operations. In addition to that, Ahmed M. M. Alaqad, the primary operator of Buy Cash, was given a punishment. There is evidence to suggest that Buy Cash was involved in wealth transfers between al Qaeda affiliates and ISIS. In addition, the action taken by the Treasury Department targeted people such as Musa Muhammad Salim Dudin and Abdelbasit Hamza Elhassan Mohamed Khair, who were reportedly involved in facilitating the movement of cash for Hamas. Other people who are subject to sanctions include Ahmed Sadu Jahleb, Amer Kamal Sharif Alshawa, Aiman Ahmad Al-Duwaik, and Walid Mohammed Mustafa Jadallah. All of these people are believed to have positions in organizations that are controlled by Hamas. Those sanctioned include Hamas operatives Muhammad Ahmad 'Abd Al-Dayim Nasrallah and Ayman Nofal, both of whom were recently slain in an Israeli attack. The Situation By soliciting donations in bitcoin, Hamas sought to get around restrictions imposed by the United States. However, this endeavor was unsuccessful as a result of the harsh steps that were taken by the United States Treasury to clamp down on operations of this kind. The government of Joe Biden, which is dedicated to imposing further expenses on Hamas and their funding, has placed an emphasis on the need for additional sanctions. The dedication of the United States Treasury to thwarting the funding of terrorist organizations is reflected in the tightening of sanctions against Hamas, particularly in the field of virtual currencies. This action reflects the rising concern about the use of digital assets in terror funding as well as the proactive strategy taken by the United States government to combat this danger.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Cathie Wood, the renowned Bitcoin advocate and founder of ARK Invest, has recently intensified her firm's investment in the cryptocurrency-friendly trading platform Robinhood (HOOD). ARK Invest made a significant move by acquiring 1.1 million Robinhood shares on November 8, amounting to an investment of over $9.5 million in a single day. This acquisition involved three of ARK's innovation-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs): the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). The ARKK fund led the charge, purchasing 888,500 shares of HOOD, which constituted 78% of the total shares bought that day. Prior to this substantial purchase, ARK had been steadily buying Robinhood shares, albeit in smaller quantities compared to the latest transaction. For instance, the day before, ARK had acquired 259,628 shares for its ARKW fund, followed by another purchase of 197,285 shares on October 23. This aggressive investment strategy coincided with Robinhood's announcement of its plans to expand into Europe, specifically eyeing the launch of brokerage services in the United Kingdom in the coming weeks. This move by Robinhood was announced amidst a challenging period for the company, as its stock price (HOOD) dropped over 14% following an earnings report that fell short of expectations, primarily due to reduced trading volume and a shrinking customer base. On November 8, the closing price of Robinhood's stock was reported by TradingView as $8.37. In a parallel development, ARK has been divesting from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On the same day, ARKW sold 48,477 GBTC shares, totaling approximately $1.4 million. Since October 24, ARK has offloaded a total of 427,573 GBTC shares, valued at around $11.9 million at the time of this report. This selling trend is nearing the total GBTC shares ARK sold in November 2022. In addition to these market moves, ARK has announced plans to launch new ETFs focusing on Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts. This initiative will be in collaboration with 21Shares, ARK's primary partner in cryptocurrency ETFs. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Strategic Alliance for Digital Asset Security India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has engaged Liminal, a Singapore-based digital asset custodian, to manage and secure digital assets confiscated in criminal investigations. This strategic partnership emerges against the backdrop of a surge in cryptocurrency-related frauds in India, highlighting the growing concerns in this sector. Rising Concerns Over Cryptocurrency Frauds Recently, India has witnessed a spate of cryptocurrency scams, leading to significant financial losses and several arrests. Two of the most notable cases include a $300 million scam with 18 arrests and a $120 million fraud resulting in at least two arrests. These incidents underscore the increasing challenges in regulating the digital asset ecosystem and preventing its misuse for illicit activities. Liminal\u2019s Role in Enhancing Digital Asset Security Liminal, under the leadership of Mahin Gupta, co-founder of ZebPay, an early player in India's cryptocurrency exchange market, has stepped up to the challenge. The company, known for its robust security measures, raised $4.7 million in mid-2022 from prominent investors like Elevation Capital, Andreas Antonopoulos, Balaji Srinivasan, and Sandeep Nailwal. Liminal\u2019s expertise in creating multi-signature and multi-party computation wallets positions it as a capable partner for the CBI in ensuring the security of seized digital assets. Senior Vice President of Strategy and Business Operations at Liminal, Manan Vora, expressed pride in their collaboration with the CBI, stating, \u201CWe consider our partnership with the CBI as a testament to our unwavering dedication to building a safe and regulated digital asset ecosystem in India. As experts in the field, we feel it\u2019s our responsibility to assist law enforcement agencies with rigorous security protocols.\u201D CBI\u2019s Discretion in Ongoing Investigations The CBI, known for its discretion in ongoing investigations, has not disclosed specific details of the operations involving confiscated digital assets. However, their gratitude towards Liminal for their assistance and involvement in securing these assets has been publicly acknowledged. The CBI\u2019s initiative to partner with Liminal for the custody of seized digital assets marks a critical step in addressing the security challenges in the cryptocurrency sector. This collaboration not only reinforces the need for enhanced security measures but also showcases the potential of public-private partnerships in regulating and safeguarding the digital asset ecosystem in India.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-09",
        "detailedArticleContent": "During a CNBC interview at DC Fintech Week, SEC Chair Gary Gensler discussed the potential revival of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, emphasizing the importance of operating within legal boundaries. The context for this comes in the wake of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's recent fraud conviction and the company's bankruptcy last year. FTX, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, was once a cryptocurrency exchange titan, known for its innovative approach and rapid growth in the crypto world. However, its reputation nosedived following revelations of financial mismanagement and legal violations, leading to a bankruptcy filing in late 2022. This downfall highlighted the risks and regulatory loopholes in the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. Gensler's remarks followed reports of Tom Farley, ex-president of the New York Stock Exchange and founder of digital asset exchange Bullish, being a top contender in the bankruptcy auction to purchase FTX. Gensler advised anyone considering entering the crypto exchange market to focus on earning investor trust, ensuring proper disclosures, and avoiding conflicts of interest, such as trading against customers or misusing their assets. The conversation pivoted to Sam Bankman-Fried's conviction on charges including fraud and money laundering. FTX, once a leading crypto exchange, was revealed to have inappropriately channeled customer funds to its sister hedge fund, Alameda Research. Alameda, a market maker for FTX, enjoyed unfair advantages such as a significant line of credit without collateral and leniency in trading positions, unlike other customers. Sam Bankman-Fried, the young entrepreneur behind FTX, experienced a dramatic turn of events with his recent conviction on multiple counts, including fraud and money laundering. Gensler reinforced the SEC's commitment to applying existing securities laws to the crypto industry, stating their compatibility and robustness. He highlighted the challenges of global compliance in the crypto space, particularly with entities like Binance facing allegations from U.S. regulators for evading rules. Gensler's comments also touched on the need for stricter adherence to international sanctions and anti-money laundering laws in the cryptocurrency sector. The SEC, under Gensler's leadership, has been actively pursuing legal actions in the crypto space, with over 150 cases in the past six years. High-profile cases include those against Ripple and Grayscale. The SEC's stance remains firm on the necessity for companies, including major players like Coinbase, to comply with U.S. laws, with Gensler asserting the undesirability of non-compliant or fraudulent actors in the market.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-09",
        "detailedArticleContent": "U.S. Representative Tom Emmer, currently serving as the GOP Majority Whip, has been a prominent figure in the debate over the regulation of digital assets. His legislative efforts have consistently focused on clarifying and limiting the regulatory scope of agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the digital asset space. Emmer's stance reflects a broader push within certain political circles to establish clearer legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies and related technologies, aiming to encourage innovation while providing investor protection. On November 9, 2023, Emmer's latest nonpartisan amendment, designed to restrain the SEC from using taxpayer funds for enforcement actions against the digital asset industry, was passed in the House of Representatives. This amendment comes at a crucial time when the SEC, under the leadership of Gary Gensler, has been intensifying scrutiny and enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency sector. The relationship between Emmer and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been marked by disagreements over the SEC's approach to digital asset regulation. Emmer has been vocal in criticizing what he perceives as the SEC's overreach and lack of clear regulatory guidelines, which, according to him, stifles innovation in the burgeoning digital asset market. Gensler, on the other hand, has advocated for robust SEC oversight in the sector, citing investor protection and market integrity as top priorities. Emmer's amendment puts a temporary halt on SEC's enforcement actions in the digital asset domain, pending the passage of specific legislation that defines the SEC's regulatory authority. This move is seen by many as a bid to bring legislative clarity to an area that has been mired in uncertainty. It also represents a significant shift in the power dynamics between Congress and regulatory bodies like the SEC, emphasizing the role of elected representatives in shaping the regulatory landscape. As the digital asset industry continues to evolve, the interplay between legislative bodies and regulatory agencies will be crucial in shaping its future. Emmer's amendment signals a legislative intent to take a more active role in this domain, potentially leading to more comprehensive and well-defined laws governing digital assets.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Switzerland-based cryptocurrency bank SEBA Bank has marked a significant milestone by obtaining a license from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The license, granted on November 3rd, represents a crucial step for SEBA in expanding its cryptocurrency services in the Asia Pacific region. SEBA Hong Kong, a subsidiary of SEBA Bank, is now authorized to offer a range of cryptocurrency-related services within the area, as confirmed by the SFC's official website. SEBA Bank established its first Hong Kong office in November 2022, underlining its strategy to broaden its service spectrum in Asia. Following an initial permission in principle from the SFC in August 2023 for virtual asset trading services, the recent licensing confirms SEBA\u2019s operational expansion outside its home country, including a presence in Abu Dhabi. With this new license, SEBA can engage in the trading and distribution of all securities, encompassing digital asset-related products like over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Moreover, the license allows SEBA to provide advisory services on securities and digital assets and manage assets for discretionary accounts, which include both traditional and digital assets. SEBA's services, facilitated by this license, will cater to institutional and professional investors such as corporate treasuries, funds, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals. Franz Bergmueller, the Chief Executive Officer of SEBA, expressed enthusiasm in an official statement, highlighting Hong Kong's pivotal role in the cryptocurrency economy since Bitcoin's inception and the bank\u2019s eagerness to contribute to Hong Kong\u2019s digital asset market. Hong Kong\u2019s rigorous licensing system permits only a select few platforms to cater to both local and foreign clients, including retail customers. Upon the government's announcement to license crypto-related businesses, approximately one hundred firms showed interest in establishing Hong Kong branches. However, only a handful have successfully navigated the regulatory landscape to obtain clearance. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Kazakhstan's Ministry of Culture and Information has clarified its decision to block the global cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, within the nation's borders. The ministry asserts that the trading of cryptocurrencies on Coinbase is in direct violation of the Kazakhstani law on Digital Assets. This clarification was provided in response to an inquiry from \"Kursiv,\" following a request from the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations, and Aerospace Industry. The request was made to block access to Coinbase, which contravened section 5 of Article 11 of the country\u2019s Digital Assets Law. This particular section of the law prohibits the issuance and trading of unsecured digital assets, as well as the operations of cryptocurrency exchanges dealing with such assets, outside of the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC). Only a select group of cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Bybit among others, are licensed to operate in Kazakhstan, with the AIFC's Committee for Regulation of Financial Services being the authorizing body. The move to block Coinbase was in accordance with the nation's communication laws that oblige providers to limit access to websites containing prohibited content. This has raised questions about the regulatory environment for digital assets within Kazakhstan and the implications for global cryptocurrency operations. The Ministry also addressed the earlier blocks imposed on the websites of Interactive Brokers and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), both of which were subsequently lifted. The restoration of access to these sites occurred after significant feedback from the financial community and a request from the Financial Monitoring Agency to resume access to www.interactivebrokers.com. The AIFC offers a unique regulatory sandbox environment, allowing both local and international companies to apply for operation within the center with minimal initial resources. These companies can offer FinTech and RegTech services, with the opportunity to develop regulatory requirements in collaboration with the AFSA. The reinstatement of access to Interactive Brokers and NYMEX, despite their previous infractions, signifies the delicate balance Kazakhstan seeks to maintain between stringent financial regulations and the fostering of an innovative financial technology ecosystem. In an unrelated but simultaneous report, the FINANCE.kz telegram channel first highlighted the widespread blocking of foreign brokers and cryptocurrency exchanges in Kazakhstan on September 14. This has been a topic of heated discussion among financial analysts, with some, like Rasul Rysmambetov, calling it an \"absolute mistake\" attributable to potential technical errors. Interactive Brokers, a major U.S. brokerage firm, and NYMEX, a primary American futures exchange, both now have restored access in Kazakhstan. Interactive Brokers is known for its extensive electronic trading platform in the U.S., while NYMEX holds a prominent position in crude oil futures trading. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Bitfinex, a famous cryptocurrency exchange located in Hong Kong, has announced a security compromise that has been controlled. The incident was the result of a phishing effort that was directed at one of the company's customer care representatives. The incident took place between the 30th of October and the 5th of November and entailed illegal access to a portion of the company's customer support boards. These boards contained user information that was out of current and incomplete. Bitfinex provided more details on the security breach in a statement that was made public on November 4 and emphasized that the impacted customer support forums only included \"partial, incomplete, and outdated information.\" Because the compromised agent did not have senior-level rights, the phishing attempt did not result in a broad data breach. This kept the infected agent from having access to support tools and helpdesk requests. Bitfinex has certified that the fundamental infrastructure of the exchange, including servers, wallets, and database systems, has remained intact and unbreached despite the unlawful access that was granted to the company. The prompt action taken by the exchange to resolve the problem guaranteed that there would be no loss of client cash and that the confidentiality of password information would be maintained. Bitfinex has responded to the situation by conducting a review of the information that was exposed and has begun communicating with the impacted clients, the majority of whom owned dormant or empty accounts. The relevant authorities have been informed, which demonstrates Bitfinex's dedication to both legal compliance and joint efforts to track down and capture the offender(s). After the incident, Bitfinex reaffirmed its commitment to providing its employees with continual security training and the implementation of stringent security standards. In spite of the fact that the exchange has a history of achieving convictions against previous attackers, this most recent episode serves as a reminder of the ever-present hazards that exist inside the area of digital assets. The proactive approach that Bitfinex takes with regard to cybersecurity is shown by the solid connection that the exchange has with law enforcement authorities and the regular security checks that are performed.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The cryptocurrency community faced a significant security breach when a fake Ledger Live application, titled \"Ledger Live Web3,\" appeared in the Microsoft App Store, leading to substantial financial losses for unsuspecting users. Notorious for mimicking the genuine interface of Ledger's hardware wallet application, this fraudulent software managed to siphon off a sizeable sum before its removal. Cryptocurrency investigator ZachXBT first brought attention to this scam on November 5, 2023, warning users of the counterfeit application. Analysis of the transactions to the scammer's Bitcoin address (bc1q...y64q) revealed the theft of approximately 16.8 Bitcoins, amounting to around $588,000, through 38 transactions. Further scrutiny indicated an additional address associated with the scheme accumulating roughly $180,000 across the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks. Microsoft responded by removing the deceptive application following the uproar. However, questions about their app vetting process and accountability have risen, especially since it's not the inaugural instance of such a scam. Reports from victims have intensified the call for stringent app store oversight and highlighted the risks associated with downloading cryptocurrency-related applications from less stringent sources. The activity in the scammer's wallet commenced with a transaction dated October 24, suggesting a well-orchestrated plan that escalated from November 2. The largest single transfer recorded was $81,200 on November 4. Historical data indicated that the faux \"Ledger Live Web3\" app was listed on Microsoft's platform as early as October 19. This event serves as a stark reminder of the dangers lurking in seemingly secure app stores and the importance of rigorous due diligence before downloading any financial management software.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-06",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In the continuing saga of Ripple versus the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), recent developments suggest a leaning in favor of Ripple, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space. Legal experts and community stakeholders are weighing in on the potential outcomes and implications of the case. John Deaton, a leading cryptocurrency attorney, has offered his insight, framing the situation as a significant victory for Ripple, should the case settle for $20 million or less. Deaton\u2019s comments came in response to general opinions mistaking the case\u2019s conclusion for a balanced verdict between Ripple and the SEC. Instead, Deaton affirms a 90\/10 advantage in favor of Ripple, negating the previously held 50\/50 assumption. These remarks align with Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty's note on yet another legal setback for the SEC, referencing the outcome of the SEC vs. Govil case. The Second Circuit Court\u2019s ruling against the SEC\u2019s ability to seek large disgorgement orders without showing actual financial harm to investors strengthens Ripple's stance. The community has echoed this sentiment, with figures like Wayne Vaughan and Crypto Adviser voicing their perspectives on Twitter, pointing towards a skewed settlement that favors Ripple and criticizing the SEC\u2019s approach to investor protection. The case, initially launched by the SEC in December 2020, accused Ripple Labs of conducting an unregistered securities offering via XRP sales. This development underscored the growing scrutiny around digital currencies and the SEC's role in regulating them. The recent approval by Judge Torres of a joint request from the SEC and Ripple to establish a briefing schedule on institutional XRP sales further indicates a progression towards a conclusion. This request, linked to allegations of Rule 10b-5 violations by Ripple, sets a stage for both parties to present a comprehensive briefing schedule by November 9. As the Ripple vs. SEC case evolves, the implications for the regulatory framework governing digital currencies remain significant. The legal fraternity and crypto community are closely monitoring the unfolding events, with the consensus tilting towards a favorable lean for Ripple. The final resolution of this case could set a precedent for future securities offerings and regulatory actions within the crypto space. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-04",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Fort Lauderdale, FL: Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), known for its endeavors in bolstering the Bitcoin infrastructure, has announced a collaboration with renewable energy firm Nodal Power. The partnership aims to harness methane emissions from a Utah landfill to power a 280 kW Bitcoin mining pilot project. The project, now fully operational, underscores a sustainable model for cryptocurrency mining, mitigating the environmental impact associated with the significant energy demands of such operations. Methane, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is a potent greenhouse gas, with an impact \"80 times more harmful than CO2 for 20 years post emission.\" With municipal solid waste contributing to around 14.3% of the total methane emissions in the U.S. in 2021, as per the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the initiative by Marathon addresses a critical environmental challenge. Marathon's project is a testament to the possibility of transforming harmful methane emissions from landfills into a renewable energy source for powering Bitcoin mining operations. This project forms part of a larger Marathon initiative aimed at validating the process of capturing, converting, and utilizing landfill methane emissions for electricity generation to fuel Bitcoin miners. Fred Thiel, Marathon's Chairman and CEO, highlighted the broader environmental and operational goals, stating, \u201CBy capturing methane emitted from landfills and converting it into electricity, we may be able to lower our energy costs, diversify our operations, and contribute positively to the environment.\" The global cryptocurrency mining sector is on a quest for sustainable energy solutions. For instance, Genesis Digital Assets Limited recently commenced operations at a hydroelectric-powered facility in Sweden, illustrating the growing trend towards eco-friendly mining practices. Additionally, Marathon itself inaugurated a 200-MW immersion-cooled plant in Abu Dhabi's Masdar City in October. The initiative by Marathon and Nodal Power not only aligns with the global sustainability goals but also sets a precedent for other cryptocurrency mining entities to explore environmentally friendly energy alternatives. Despite achieving a mining milestone of 2,926 Bitcoin in Q2 2023, Marathon reported earnings that fell below expectations. The firm's Q2 revenues soared to $132.8 million, marking a 228% surge compared to the previous year. The pilot project by Marathon Digital Holdings exhibits a pioneering effort in marrying cryptocurrency mining with renewable energy solutions, reflecting a growing consciousness within the digital asset sector towards environmental sustainability.

        "creationDate": "2023-11-03",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida issued a decision concerning the designation of Tornado Cash by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The case, identified as Case 3:22-cv-20375-TKW-ZCB, revolved around the designation of Tornado Cash under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The IEEPA authorizes the president to declare national emergencies to handle unusual foreign threats to the United States' national security, foreign policy, or economy. Utilizing this authority, the president had declared national emergencies concerning malicious foreign cyber-enabled activities and North Korea's nuclear missile program. Tornado Cash, a service utilizing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to provide a degree of anonymity to transactions, was designated by OFAC on August 8, 2022, and later re-designated on November 8, 2022. This designation was challenged by the plaintiffs, who are users and a non-profit cryptocurrency advocacy organization. They argued that the designation of Tornado Cash's core software tool exceeded OFAC's statutory authority since it is mere computer code and no foreign entity has a legally recognized \"property interest.\" The designation listed 91 internet addresses affiliated with Tornado Cash, aiming to block and prohibit transactions through these addresses. The Court's decision upheld OFAC's designation. It rejected the plaintiffs' argument, stating that the operative language in the IEEPA is \"any interest,\" not \"property interest\" or \"ownership interest.\" According to the Court, Tornado Cash's founders, developers, and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) have an indirect beneficial \"interest\" through the service's usage, which increases the value of Tornado Cash's governance token, TORN. The Court explained that an increased usage of Tornado Cash enhances the value of TORN, held by these entities, and thus establishes a financial \"interest\" for the purposes of the IEEPA. Furthermore, the Court found that OFAC's decision was not arbitrary or capricious and was adequately justified based on the foreign-affairs rationale, particularly given Tornado Cash's involvement in laundering cryptocurrency for the benefit of the North Korean government. The Court also dismissed the plaintiffs' First Amendment claims, stating the designation didn\u2019t implicate Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights as there are other privacy tools available for them. In conclusion, the Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, thereby upholding OFAC's designation of Tornado Cash under the IEEPA. This judgment underscores the legal challenges faced by privacy-centric blockchain services in light of national security and foreign policy concerns. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-11-02",
        "detailedArticleContent": "PayPal, a notable player in the global payments realm, has secured approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer cryptocurrency-related services in the United Kingdom. The authorization was disclosed on the FCA's website, affirming that PayPal has been registered for \"certain crypto asset activities\" in the region since October 31, 2023. This development is part of PayPal's broader scheme to establish a dedicated facility in the UK, aligning with the post-Brexit operational landscape. The FCA mandates companies aspiring to delve into cryptocurrency offerings to exhibit robust measures preventing the misuse of cryptocurrencies for money laundering or terrorist financing. This regulatory scrutiny comes as the UK's cryptocurrency sector anticipates its inaugural regulatory framework. The approval marks a significant stride for PayPal, which had temporarily suspended cryptocurrency purchases for its UK user base earlier in October. The action was a compliance measure in response to the evolving legislative milieu in the UK, as reported in August. Following the approval, a noteworthy operational shift is set to occur. Effective November 1, UK clientele of PayPal will transition from PayPal Europe, which had hitherto serviced them, to a newly established entity within the UK. This maneuver is a direct consequence of the UK's departure from the European Union, ensuring that PayPal continues to offer its array of products and services to the UK market seamlessly. Although the registration permits PayPal to engage in specific crypto asset activities, it comes with a set of limitations. The FCA register underscores that PayPal's crypto services will be confined, including a halt on on-boarding new customers and restricting existing ones to hold and sell functionalities. The firm is precluded from extending its crypto asset offerings, encompassing crypto exchange services, participation in initial coin offerings, staking, peer-to-peer exchange, and decentralized finance operations. PayPal\u2019s acquisition of the FCA crypto license places it as the fourth entity to attain such registration, following Interactive Brokers, Bitstamp, and Komainu. This could potentially fortify the UK\u2019s stance in the burgeoning Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency domain. The unfolding scenario reflects the UK\u2019s and PayPal\u2019s concerted efforts to adapt to the post-Brexit economic and regulatory tapestry, whilst fostering a conducive environment for cryptocurrency operations and compliance.

        "detailedArticleContent": "On October 31, the Japanese government announced the freezing of assets belonging to nine individuals and one cryptocurrency trading company accused of financially aiding the Palestinian militant group Hamas, as per Kyodo News. This action comes amidst an ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, with other nations like the United States taking similar steps to curb the financial streams that fuel Hamas's activities. The Japanese government\u2019s decision targets entities purportedly involved in the financial support of Hamas, which is engaged in rocket attacks against Israel. Hirokazu Matsuno, Japan's Defence Minister, during a press briefing, emphasized on continued evaluation of potential sanctions from a counterterrorism financing perspective. The United States had previously enforced sanctions against individuals and entities associated with Hamas on October 18. The US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated ten individuals and entities, extending beyond the Gaza Strip to Sudan, Türkiye, Algeria, and Qatar. This action aimed at dismantling Hamas\u2019s financial network, aligns with the broader international initiative to disrupt terrorist financing. The involvement of a cryptocurrency trading company in this case sheds light on the growing global concern over digital financial platforms facilitating illicit financial flows, a matter that has been underscored by the US sanctions targeting a Gaza-based virtual currency exchange. These actions by Japan and the US reflect a growing international consensus to tackle terrorism financing. The measures add a financial dimension to the efforts aimed at curbing militant activities in the Middle East, amidst the continuing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-10-30",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Chief Executive Officer of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has voiced his disagreement with the regulatory posture taken by Jay Clayton, who formerly served as Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This criticism surfaced in response to statements made by Clayton during an interview with CNBC on June 29, 2023. Clayton was discussing the SEC's more aggressive legal stance against corporations, especially those operating in the cryptocurrency industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started taking a number of regulatory measures against cryptocurrency organizations and exchanges at the beginning of 2023 in an effort to safeguard investors. The regulatory environment has been significantly disrupted as a result of these moves, which has increased the level of legal uncertainty for a variety of crypto organizations. In an interview with CNBC, Clayton said that legal action should only be conducted against corporations that have good legal grounds, and he emphasized that regulatory agencies should provide claims and policies that are capable of withstanding the examination of a court. In his response to Clayton's interview, Garlinghouse pointed out the irony of the situation, particularly in light of the fact that the SEC had previously initiated a case against Ripple when Clayton was in charge of the agency. Ripple, Garlinghouse, and Christian Larsen, the co-founder of Ripple, were accused in a lawsuit that was filed in December 2020 of arranging a \"unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering,\" and it was claimed that they made more than $1.3 billion from the sale of XRP. Garlinghouse brought out the inconsistency between Clayton's words and his actions and emphasized the flimsy legal foundation of the SEC's case against Ripple, which intended to categorize XRP as a security. He did this by pointing out the discrepancy between Clayton's words and his actions. The disclosure of Clayton's remarks from June 2023 has emerged as a topic of conversation among the parties engaged in the current court procedures, which are still ongoing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) submitted a petition in October asking the court to dismiss the allegations against Garlinghouse and Larsen without prejudice, which further stirred the current discussion about the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.

The bill, seen as moderate, outlines pragmatic mandates for VASPs while leaving room for further regulatory fine-tuning, marking a significant step in Taiwan\u2019s evolving digital asset regulatory landscape.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-29",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On October 25, Taiwanese legislators tabled the Virtual Asset Management Bill before the single-chamber parliament, the Legislative Yuan. This initiative seeks to bolster consumer protection and furnish better oversight over the burgeoning digital asset sector. The 30-page document delineates several pragmatic obligations for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Noteworthy mandates include the segregation of client funds from the firm\u2019s operational reserves, the inception of an internal audit and control system, and membership in local trade associations pertinent to digital assets. Although the bill is seen as moderate, it forgoes the imposition of a 1:1 reserve requirement for stablecoin issuers and does not delve into the realm of algorithmic stablecoins. The legislation also outlines penalties for unlicensed VASPs operations, establishing fines ranging from 2 million Taiwanese dollars (approximately $60,000) to 20 million TWD (around $600,000). Existing market participants have been granted a six-month window post-enactment to secure the necessary licensure. This legislative venture follows the September 2023 guidelines issued by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) of Taiwan, which barred foreign VASPs from operating within Taiwanese jurisdiction without requisite approvals. This move comes amidst the formation of a self-regulatory body by major crypto exchanges within Taiwan on September 26. Prominent local exchanges like MaiCoin, BitstreetX, Hoya Bit, Bitgin, Rybit, Xrex, and Shangbito congregated to establish the Taiwan Virtual Asset Platform and Transaction Business Association, aiming to foster a collaborative environment between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies. In juxtaposition with the more stringent regulatory frameworks seen in neighboring Hong Kong and Japan, Taiwan\u2019s proposal appears more lenient. Unlike Hong Kong's rigid stance on derivatives and stablecoins, and Japan's requirement for the employment of custodians by locally accredited exchanges, the Taiwanese bill merely emphasizes the separation of client and company funds. Furthermore, the bill mandates periodic reporting by exchange operators, although it doesn't specifically address Proof of Reserves. It leaves room for the regulatory body to devise asset ratio rules post consultations with industry stakeholders. This nuanced approach reflects a measured stride towards establishing a regulatory framework post the collapse of the FTX exchange in November of the previous year, which had garnered a significant user base in Taiwan due to its favorable interest rates on US dollars compared to local banking offerings. Preliminary feedback from the crypto sector in Taiwan displays a positive outlook towards the inception of formal regulatory supervision, which is seen as a constructive step towards legitimizing the industry.

Elliptic's clarification comes amidst a wave of reports suggesting that cryptocurrencies have become a substantial financing tool for Hamas. On October 10, a narrative was fueled by an article in the Wall Street Journal, titled \u201CHamas Militants Behind Israel Attack Raised Millions in Crypto\u201D. This narrative gained traction when, on October 17, over a hundred US lawmakers referenced the article in a letter to the White House and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, asserting that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) raised over $130 million in cryptocurrencies between August 2021 and June 2023, a claim Elliptic argues lacks evidentiary backing. Analysis indicates that public crypto fundraising campaigns by Hamas have not received substantial donations. The disclosure reveals that Gaza Now, a pro-Hamas news outlet, only received $21,000 in cryptocurrency donations since October 7, with $2,000 being sent to an exchange on October 9, and around $9,000 in stablecoin donations being frozen by Tether. This contrasts starkly with the reported $130 million figure cited by lawmakers. Historically, Hamas sought Bitcoin donations starting in 2019, peaking during the May 2021 regional violence outbreak. However, by April 2023, the group ceased public crypto fundraising, citing donor safety concerns. The halt followed US and Israeli law enforcement actions, including the issuance of seizure orders for Hamas-associated crypto wallets and collaboration with exchanges to freeze related accounts. Further analysis by both Elliptic and Chainalysis, another blockchain forensics firm, underscores the exaggerated figures in media reports. For instance, one wallet purported to have received $82 million over seven and a half months had only $450,000 associated with terrorism, as per Chainalysis. The analysis reveals a significant misrepresentation of facts concerning the extent of cryptocurrency's role in funding terrorism. Notably, the scrutiny on Hamas's crypto funding coincides with thriving crypto fundraising for humanitarian causes in Israel. As of October 19, Crypto Aid Israel amassed over $185,000 in cryptocurrency donations to aid those affected by the attacks, showcasing the potential positive impact of cryptocurrencies. Elliptic stressed the importance of nuanced blockchain analysis to avoid misinformation, emphasizing its long-standing commitment to preventing crypto assets' illicit use. The firm advocates for a balanced understanding and reporting on the multifaceted issues surrounding cryptocurrency and terrorism financing. Image source: Shutterstock"

The bill, dubbed \"Digital Financial Asset Transaction Kiosks,\" recommends a daily withdrawal limit of $1,000 and a cap on operators' fees, with implementation eyed for January 1, 2024.

        "detailedArticleContent": "In a bid to curb the rising tide of fraudulent activities, California lawmakers have introduced a measure termed \"Digital Financial Asset Transaction Kiosks.\" The measure advocates for a daily withdrawal limit of $1,000 from cryptocurrency ATMs. Furthermore, the bill proposes a cap on operators' fees at $5 or 15%, whichever is greater, effective from the year 2025. If enacted, the implementation of these regulations is slated to commence on January 1, 2024. The legislation came on the heels of a visit by legislative members to a cryptocurrency automated teller machine (ATM) in Sacramento. During the visit, they unearthed markups on certain cryptocurrencies that were as much as 33 percent higher than their values on cryptocurrency exchanges. A subsequent investigation by the legislators revealed that the fees levied by a cryptocurrency ATM oscillate between 12% and 25% on average. Moreover, government authorities discovered ATMs with withdrawal limits soaring as high as $50,000, propelling them to initiate regulatory action to truncate such elevated premiums and withdrawal limits. With over 3,200 automated teller machines accepting Bitcoin dotted across California, as per Coin ATM Radar, the necessity for regulation becomes increasingly palpable. An additional facet of the law mandates companies dealing in digital financial assets to obtain a license from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation by July 2025. The nature of transactions at crypto ATMs\u2014exchanging physical cash for cryptocurrencies\u2014has turned these kiosks into fertile grounds for frauds and exploitations, whilst also being a favored avenue for consumers to trade cash for their preferred cryptocurrency. The lack of a substantial paper trail in each transaction, compared to traditional bank and wire transactions, further exacerbates the potential for fraudulent activities. Recently, numerous locals have been ensnared in scams where fraudsters persuade victims to deposit cash at nearby cryptocurrency ATMs in exchange for cryptocurrencies. Image source: Shutterstock"

Acquired at a mere $620 at the Ethereum Genesis, this move not only underscores Ethereum's substantial price appreciation but also hints at potential market dynamics as long-dormant assets re-enter circulation. The transaction could signal various intents, from cashing out to redistributing or reinvesting the holdings, each with its own set of implications for the Ethereum market.",

        "detailedArticleContent": "A participant of the initial coin offering (ICO) for Ethereum has emerged from an 8.2-year hiatus, transferring their entire stash of 2,000 ETH, valued at $3.2 million, to four distinct addresses. This event occurred on October 21, 2023, as reported by Lookonchain via Twitter. The transaction showcases not only the price appreciation of Ethereum but also the potential market dynamics induced by long-term dormant cryptocurrency holdings transitioning to active status. The participant acquired these 2,000 ETH during Ethereum's genesis phase at an approximate total cost of $620, given the ICO price of approximately $0.31 per ETH. The tweet included a link to the Etherscan page showing the transactions from the address 0x6403d062549690c8e8b63eae41d6c109476e2588. The remarkable price appreciation highlights the enormous potential for early adopters in the cryptocurrency space, with the value of the assets skyrocketing from about $620 to $3.2 million over a span of 8.2 years. Market Implications The reactivation and transfer of assets from long-dormant cryptocurrency wallets to exchanges can evoke various reactions within the market and the cryptocurrency community. These transactions are often closely monitored and speculated upon, generating discussions and narratives that may impact market sentiment and price dynamics in the short term. Cryptocurrency exchanges may see an influx of ETH, which could potentially affect the asset's price depending on the subsequent actions taken by the ICO participant Large transfers from dormant addresses are sometimes perceived by the market as a prelude to selling, which could potentially put downward pressure on the price of the cryptocurrency involved. This concern may escalate especially in cases where a substantial amount of cryptocurrency is moved, potentially affecting market liquidity, more so if the cryptocurrency has a relatively smaller market cap. Beyond the immediate market reactions, the reactivation of long-dormant wallets carries sentimental or symbolic significance. It highlights the patience and long-term vision of early adopters, reflecting the historical narrative of the cryptocurrency in question. Such events showcase real-world examples of significant asset appreciation over time, underscoring the potential rewards for long-term holders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        "creationDate": "2023-10-21",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A concerted effort is underway to defend against the lawsuit filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance. This lawsuit, rooted in allegations dating back to at least July 2017, claims that Binance, under the stewardship of CEO Changpeng Zhao, operated as unregistered exchanges, brokers, dealers, and clearing agencies, thereby generating substantial revenue primarily from transaction fees from U.S. customers1. In light of these allegations, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, headquartered in the United States, has mobilized alongside a myriad of other businesses, groups, legal experts, and politicians to challenge the SEC's lawsuit. The core of this collective resistance is captured in a recent amicus brief. The document articulates a dual objective: firstly, to challenge the SEC's mode of regulation through enforcement, and secondly, to halt the SEC's initiative to regulate the cryptocurrency sector without explicit authorization from the United States Congress. The amicus brief underscores a broader industry sentiment concerning the SEC's jurisdiction over digital assets, positing that the SEC lacks the necessary legislative mandate to classify all digital assets as securities. Pivoting on this argument, the Chamber of Digital Commerce has petitioned the court to dismiss the SEC's case against Binance. The grounds for dismissal underscore the SEC's alleged overreach, the assertion that digital assets do not constitute investment contracts, and the claim that token transactions do not meet the Exchange Act registration requisites. This motion resonates with the stance of Binance.US, Binance Holdings, and CEO Changpeng Zhao, who have jointly filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that the SEC has overstepped its authoritative boundaries. Furthermore, Binance.US has voiced its concerns regarding the SEC's latest requests for document discovery and depositions, denouncing them as unreasonable. This stance was fortified when Binance.US, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, formally objected to the SEC's request for additional information, submitting the necessary documentation to express its dissent. The collaborative endeavor spearheaded by the Chamber of Digital Commerce not only signifies a robust defense against the SEC's lawsuit but also underscores a broader industry pushback against the SEC's regulatory approach towards the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. This collaborative resistance illuminates the ongoing tension between regulatory authorities and cryptocurrency entities, a dynamic that continues to evolve amidst the unfolding legal discourse surrounding Binance.US.

The analysis highlights the challenges and common misconceptions in tracing terrorist fund flows on the blockchain, particularly concerning service provider identification.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-19",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In light of the recent terrorist attack in Israel orchestrated by Hamas, Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, addresses the misconceptions surrounding cryptocurrency's role in terrorism financing in a blog post dated October 18, 2023. The analysis reveals that terrorism financing represents a minuscule portion of the already marginal illicit cryptocurrency transaction volume. While terrorist groups do utilize cryptocurrencies, they predominantly rely on traditional fiat-based financing channels like financial institutions, hawalas, and shell companies. Blockchain technology, known for its inherent transparency, renders cryptocurrency less suitable for illicit activities, including terrorism financing. This transparency enables government and private sector entities equipped with blockchain analysis tools to collaboratively identify and impede fund flows, a feat challenging to achieve with traditional value transfer methods. Chainalysis particularly discusses the common pitfalls when analyzing terrorist fund flows on the blockchain, especially concerning service provider identification and tracing. Two essential aspects form the crux of analyzing terrorism-related fund flows: quantifying the funds directly held by terrorist organizations, and identifying the service providers facilitating fund movements. Instances of terrorism financing often involve service providers like money services businesses, with the recently sanctioned Gaza-based business, Buy Cash, cited as an example. These service providers handle fund volumes larger than a typical individual yet smaller than a standard exchange, resembling over-the-counter (OTC) brokers or street-level money businesses like hawalas to varying extents. The recent sanctions by the US Treasury Department on October 18, 2023, against nine individuals associated with Hamas and a Gaza-based cryptocurrency exchange are part of a broader effort to staunch the revenue flow to the group. These measures specifically target senior Hamas officials and members managing a clandestine Hamas investment portfolio, alongside the implicated virtual currency exchange. Besides the funds Hamas receives from Iran, its global investment portfolio, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, significantly contributes to its revenue. This portfolio, managed under the guise of legitimate businesses in various countries including Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, forms a crucial part of Hamas's financial network. Parallel to the US actions, Israeli authorities have been proactive in clamping down on cryptocurrency channels funding Hamas. On October 10, 2023, the cyber branch of the Israel Police's Lahav 433 unit froze cryptocurrency accounts belonging to Hamas. Additionally, multiple social media posts over the preceding week soliciting cryptocurrency donations for Hamas-related organizations were noted by Israeli law enforcement. In a noteworthy development, Hamas declared the cessation of its cryptocurrency donation program in April 2023, indicating a potential shift in its fundraising strategies amidst increasing international scrutiny. The narrative surrounding the role of cryptocurrencies in terrorism financing often leads to overblown claims, mainly when tracing funds on the blockchain. The recent actions by both US and Israeli authorities highlight the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies in curbing terrorism financing while also emphasizing the adaptability of regulatory measures to counter illicit crypto operations. The collaborative efforts between law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and private sector organizations, exemplified by the recent actions against Hamas's cryptocurrency operations, showcase the potential in leveraging blockchain technology to understand and disrupt terrorism-supporting financial networks. The developments emphasize the need for a nuanced approach in assessing the role of cryptocurrencies in terrorism financing, reinforcing the assertions by Chainalysis on the limited scope of crypto in fueling terrorist activities.

Comprising approximately 20 prosecutors, these units aim to tackle challenges posed by technological advancements in criminal activities. Two Types of Tech Crimes Wang Shouren, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the AGC, stated in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao that technology-enabled crimes mainly fall into two categories. The first involves crimes directly related to technology, such as hacking into computer systems. The second category consists of technology-facilitated crimes, which are traditional crimes aided by technology, like digital forgery, online harassment, and fraud. Specialized Task Forces The AGC began focusing on this criminal trend since the late 1990s and has now formally established two task forces: the Technology Crime Task Force and the Cryptocurrency Task Force. The former deals with computer or technology-assisted crimes and handles digital evidence, while the latter focuses on issues arising from cryptocurrencies as assets, including assisting the Singapore Police Force in tracking and handling such assets. Training and Collaboration All prosecutors are required to undergo basic training in technology crimes and digital evidence. The task force members also collaborate with relevant government agencies like the Criminal Investigation Department and the Commercial Affairs Department, and even receive specialized training abroad. Wang Shouren added, \"We also maintain contact with large tech companies and social media firms, as tackling cybercrime and addressing challenges brought by technological advancements require close cooperation between the public and private sectors.\" Cross-Border Cooperation Wang cited a recent case involving a local man in Singapore who committed identity fraud in the United States, defrauding hundreds of thousands of dollars. The case highlighted the importance of international cooperation in law enforcement, especially when criminals operate across borders. Image source: Shutterstock"

Initially launched in August 2023 as a members-only feature, the portal extended its access to the public in October. Cryptocurrencies, decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have primarily been traded on unregulated online platforms, posing a significant risk to investors. This risk has been exemplified by the loss of billions of dollars in digital assets over recent years on such platforms. However, WeStreet Credit Union aims to mitigate such risks through its Crypto Portal. The credit union, a federally regulated entity, offers a secure environment for cryptocurrency transactions, ensuring a level of trust and reliability often lacking in digital-only crypto exchanges. WeStreet has joined forces with a Qualified Crypto Custodian, a trust company, to enable the management of digital assets through its online banking app, thereby providing a safer avenue for handling cryptocurrencies. The custodian, subjected to financial and technological audits, ensures robust safeguarding of digital assets. WeStreet proactively monitors crypto balances with this custodian multiple times daily, addressing any discrepancies promptly, as stated by WeStreet Credit Union President and CEO Greg Gallant. The portal also introduces an audited ledger system to monitor customers\u2019 crypto assets and account activities meticulously. This initiative allows the credit union to swiftly address and resolve any issues or discrepancies, ensuring that users have uninterrupted access to their funds for buying, selling, or holding at their convenience. In addition to facilitating secure transactions, the platform provides a selection of widely circulated coins like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Stellar, with plans to include Coins Avalanche and Chainlink by the end of October. WeStreet Credit Union, established in 1943, has continually evolved to meet the financial needs of its growing membership, which now stands at over 56,000 members, with assets exceeding $970 million. This Crypto Portal reflects WeStreet\u2019s ongoing commitment to adapting to the digital currency realm while upholding the community-centric ethos it was founded upon. Image source: Shutterstock"

The proposal aims to align the crypto market's leverage regulations with other derivative markets and possibly re-attract users who shifted to overseas exchanges for higher leverage.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-18",
        "detailedArticleContent": "On October 17, the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) presented a proposal to the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) to review the leverage ratio in cryptocurrency margin trading, according to Coinpost. JCBA argues that the current leverage ratio is overly restrictive compared to other derivative markets, suggesting a shift to a calculation method based on past price volatility (volatility), and has sought cooperation from JVCEA for the realization of the amendment proposal. Previously, the maximum leverage of 25 times, akin to the domestic Forex (foreign exchange margin trading) market, was set for individual trading in cryptocurrency margin. However, it was reduced to four times in October 2019, and further lowered to a uniform two times in May 2020 following the enforcement of the amended Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. On the other hand, for corporate transactions, a method of calculating leverage based on the past weekly price fluctuations of individual stocks had been introduced. Now, JCBA is advocating for the application of this corporate method to individual transactions as well. Currently, the leverage for corporates ranges between four to nine times. Trend Towards Volatility Stabilization Four years post the amendment of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act in 2019, the cryptocurrency market has seen expanded global recognition and an increase in participants. Consequently, since the peak in early 2018, the price fluctuations in cryptocurrency have decreased, along with a decline in speculative elements. In Japan, recent years have seen the progression in the establishment of stablecoins and tax systems, including the development of financial product transaction operators handling them, while the regulations on leverage trading have remained unchanged since the legal revisions of 2019. In 2019, the social perception towards cryptocurrency was generally that it \"mainly encourages speculation\". However, of late, there has been an increase in uses such as NFTs, payments, DAOs, and asset preservation. \"To recognize cryptocurrencies as a formal asset class, it's essential to develop the derivative market following the development of the spot market,\" emphasized JCBA. There's also an intent to attract users who moved to overseas exchanges in search of higher leverage back to Japan through the amendment of leverage ratios. Impacts of Reduced Leverage Ratios Since the legal amendment, trading volume and open interest have drastically decreased, particularly the decline in cryptocurrency margin trading compared to spot trading is notable. According to the data released by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, the effect has led to the financial instability of domestic exchanges and a subsequent outflow of individual investors seeking high-leverage exchanges abroad, contradicting investor protection viewpoints. Currently, a leverage of 25 times is set in Forex trading, and the domestic trading volume in the fiscal year 2022 grew to a colossal market reaching 1,074 trillion yen. Nevertheless, JCBA highlighted that individuals tend to restrain risk, with the effective leverage being kept at four to five times. The proposals by JCBA will be reviewed within the certified self-regulatory organization (JVCEA) and concerned parties. JVCEA holds the position of a certified self-regulatory organization under the Payment Services Act as \"Certified Payment Settlement Business Association\" and under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act as \"Certified Financial Instruments Trading Business Association\".

        "creationDate": "2023-10-17",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Recent market activities indicate a significant movement of LOOM tokens associated with Upbit, a well-known digital asset exchange. Over the past 48 hours, Upbit has escalated the frequency of depositing LOOM to other exchanges, Binance and Bithumb, summing up to over 120 transactions. This movement, involving approximately 19 million LOOM tokens (valued around $6.76 million), coincides with a 35% dip in LOOM's price within the same timeframe, according to Scopescan. A wallet affiliated with Upbit now reportedly holds a staggering 653 million LOOM, about 50% of the token's total supply, valued at approximately $181 million2. Additionally, on a separate occasion, Upbit withdrew 11,081,386 LOOM, valued at $2.9 million, and the exchange's total LOOM holdings now account for 49.45% of the token's circulating supply. The high concentration of LOOM tokens by Upbit and the recent massive transfers to Binance and Bithumb could potentially be influencing LOOM's market liquidity and price stability. The substantial holding and movement of LOOM tokens hint at a possible market manipulation scenario, which might be a contributing factor to the observed price volatility. Over the last month, LOOM's price surged over 1000%, increasing its market capitalization significantly before this recent dip4. The pattern of LOOM token movement, especially between exchanges, warrants close monitoring by both regulatory authorities and market participants. The prevailing market conditions surrounding LOOM tokens, orchestrated by hefty transactions associated with Upbit, reflect a broader narrative of market dynamics in the burgeoning cryptocurrency domain. LOOM is the native otken of Loom Network. Loom Network, based on Ethereum, serves as a platform for developers to build large-scale decentralized applications. Launched on October 1, 2017, it enhances smart contract computing power while reducing costs for certain tasks.

The move showcases the intensifying collaboration between cryptocurrency establishments and global law enforcement to counteract the rising tide of digital-financed crime. Global Collaboration Against Cybercrime Tether's proactive stance signifies a broader trend within the cryptocurrency sector to neutralize the menace of cyber-financed terrorism and unlawful activities. The firm has a history of aligning with law enforcement agencies globally, aiding 31 entities across 19 jurisdictions thus far. The cumulative effect of these collaborations has been the freezing of assets totaling $835 million, predominantly linked to theft via blockchain and exchange hacks, with a lesser portion associated with various other crimes. The collaborative endeavor spans a multitude of nations including, but not limited to, Brazil, Singapore, the Philippines, Germany, South Korea, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Greece, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, the Cayman Islands, China, Netherlands, El Salvador, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, Ukraine, Estonia, and the United States.

The firm\u2019s cooperation with the National Bureau of Counter Terrorism Financing (NBCTF) in Israel epitomizes the ongoing efforts to curb cryptocurrency-fueled terrorism and warfare. Although the figure represents a minuscule fragment of the broader $445 billion global economic cost attributed to cybercrime, it underscores the novel capabilities blockchain technologies impart to the global financial architecture in terms of security and asset recovery. Blockchain: A Double-Edged Sword Despite the potential misuse, Tether's CEO, Paolo Ardoino, emphasizes the traceability feature inherent in blockchain technology, dispelling the common misperception of cryptocurrency transactions being veiled in anonymity. \"Cryptocurrency is a powerful tool, but it is not a tool for crime,\u201D elucidates Ardoino, underscoring that every blockchain transaction is indelibly recorded, making fund movement traceable by anyone. Tether\u2019s unyielding support for law enforcement, however, does not deflect the skepticism and critique from some journalistic quarters and industry detractors. The criticism often juxtaposes the crypto industry\u2019s swift action against the seemingly languorous or inadequately equipped traditional financial systems in combating criminal financing. Tether\u2019s Persistent Vigilance Tether reiterates its enduring commitment to fostering responsible blockchain technology utilization and acting as a formidable barricade against cybercrime. This vigilance, aligned with global law enforcement agencies, accentuates the proactive measures the cryptocurrency domain is taking to stymie criminal use effectively. The ongoing efforts embody a robust testament to the blockchain\u2019s traceability, serving as a formidable deterrent against illicit activities, thereby elevating the security protocols within the global financial realm.

The law necessitates licensure from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation for individuals and businesses dealing in digital assets. This regulatory shift, contrasting Newsom\u2019s earlier stance in 2022, aligns with broader national trends towards formalizing digital asset transactions to curb fraud and enhance consumer protection.",

        "detailedArticleContent": "On October 13, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 39, enacting the Digital Financial Assets Law, aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency activities in the state. Set to be effective from July 1, 2025, the law mandates the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to devise a stringent regulatory structure encompassing licensure and enforcement mechanisms for certain cryptocurrency operations. The Governor emphasized the importance of the new law in providing a robust foundation to manage the burgeoning digital assets market. The bill entrusts the DFPI with rulemaking authority, along with an 18-month implementation timeframe to ensure a meticulously crafted regulatory architecture in sync with evolving industry trends and aimed at consumer harm mitigation. The law is a proactive attempt to bolster consumer and investor protections, thereby minimizing fraudulent activities and ensuring accountability of malicious actors within the digital asset domain. Under the new law, individuals and businesses engaging in commercial transactions involving digital assets are required to obtain a licensure from the DFPI. This move aims to bring transparency and compliance within commercial operations concerning digital assets, aligning California with the broader regulatory trends seen in various jurisdictions. The law references existing Californian legislation governing money transmission, which mandates licensing by the DFPI for banking and transfer services operating within the state. Extending this requirement to cryptocurrency transactions signifies a concerted effort to uphold regulatory standards in the face of a rapidly advancing digital asset ecosystem. Interestingly, this development contrasts with Governor Newsom's previous stance in 2022, when he chose not to sign a similar bill aimed at establishing a licensing and regulatory framework for digital assets. Despite the lack of opposition during its debate in the California State Assembly, the Governor had then returned the bill unsigned, citing the necessity for a more agile framework to keep pace with the swiftly evolving cryptocurrency sector.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Peter Kambolin, the former CEO of a Miami-based investment firm, Systematic Alpha Management LLC (SAM), pleaded guilty on October 11, 2023, to a fraudulent scheme involving cryptocurrency futures contracts, as announced by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on October 12. This marks a landmark case as it's the first criminal charge against a Commodities Trading Advisor and Commodities Pool Operator for engaging in a \"cherry-picking\" scheme concerning cryptocurrency futures contracts. Kambolin, a 48-year-old U.S.-Russian national residing in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, executed a scheme where he dishonestly allocated profitable futures trades to his personal accounts, leaving his investors with the losses. The misappropriation of trades took place between January 2019 and November 2021, a period during which Kambolin marketed his firm as a platform offering algorithmic trading strategies in futures contracts. Misrepresentation to Investors Investors were mislead to believe that SAM was focused on trading cryptocurrency futures and foreign exchange futures contracts. However, nearly 50% of Kambolin\u2019s trading in each pool was actually related to equity index futures contracts. This false representation deprived investors in the United States and overseas of profitable trades, undermining their confidence in the commodities market. Kambolin further utilized the proceeds from this fraudulent scheme to cover personal expenses, such as the rent for a beachfront apartment. Additionally, he funneled some of the funds to foreign bank accounts controlled by his co-conspirator in Belarus and Dominica. Legal Proceedings and Repercussions The fraudulent activities prompted legal action, with Kambolin now facing a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Although a sentencing date has yet to be set, the case signifies the Justice Department's dedication to prosecuting financial market malpractices using data analytics. The DOJ, together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is committed to restoring investor trust by holding individuals like Kambolin accountable for their fraudulent actions. The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Matt Kahn of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section, with the FDIC-OIG investigating. Previously, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had filed a complaint against Kambolin and SAM, shedding light on the illicit activities. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on October 12, 2023, disclosed a settlement with the beleaguered cryptocurrency firm, Voyager Digital, post allegations of misleading consumers regarding the safety of their deposits. The settlement emerges amid a broader crackdown on deceptive practices in the rapidly evolving crypto sector. Voyager Digital, under the helm of CEO Stephen Ehrlich, is alleged to have falsely claimed that consumers' deposits were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) from at least 2018 until its bankruptcy declaration in July 2022. This misrepresentation reportedly played a significant role in attracting consumers to entrust their funds to Voyager. The debacle resulted in consumers being locked out of their cash accounts for over a month, culminating in a loss exceeding $1 billion in cryptocurrency assets. Samuel Levine, the Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, emphasized the ongoing efforts to curb deceitful claims surrounding cryptocurrency assets, which witnessed over $1.4 billion in losses due to scams in the previous year alone. The action against Voyager and Ehrlich underscores the FTC's commitment to ensuring companies and individuals adhere to truthful claims, particularly regarding FDIC insurance. The settlement mandates a permanent prohibition on Voyager and its affiliates from handling consumers\u2019 assets. Furthermore, a $1.65 billion judgment has been agreed upon, albeit suspended to allow the bankruptcy proceedings to facilitate the return of remaining assets to consumers. However, former executive Stephen Ehrlich has not concurred with a settlement, thus, the litigation against him will continue in federal court. Additionally, Ehrlich's wife, Francine Ehrlich, has been named as a relief defendant in the complaint. Central to the FTC's complaint is the misrepresentation of FDIC insurance, a crucial factor for consumers deliberating on where to deposit their assets. Voyager's marketing materials, inclusive of direct assertions regarding the safety of consumers' deposits, prominently featured claims of FDIC insurance which were found to be baseless as Voyager is neither a bank nor a financial institution. The complaint further noted that the FDIC does not insure cryptocurrency assets, rendering Voyager's claims as misleading. The settlement with Voyager sends a clear message to the crypto industry regarding the veracity of claims pertaining to asset safety and insurance. The FTC's action illustrates a broader regulatory scrutiny aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer protection within the financial sector, extending beyond traditional banking to encompass emerging crypto entities. In a simultaneous action on October 12, as reported by Blockchain.News, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also charged Stephen Ehrlich with fraud and registration failures, mirroring a wider regulatory effort to uphold legal and ethical standards in the burgeoning crypto space.

The case revolves around market destabilization allegations during the May 2022 Depeg event of TerraUSD stablecoin. The motion urges disclosure of trading strategies between March and May 2022, amidst indications of Citadel Securities' alleged intentions to short UST. Terraform Labs stresses the documents' importance in countering the SEC's fraud allegations, proposing a transfer to another court for a decision if necessary.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd. (Movant), has filed a motion to compel market maker Citadel Securities, LLC to divulge crucial trading data. This data, pertinent to a third-party subpoena, is deemed critical for Terraform Labs' defense against a lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, presided over by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, delves into allegations of market destabilization due to purported intentional actions by certain market players to \"short\" and consequently cause the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin to depeg from its $1 benchmark. Disputing the SEC's allegations, Terraform Labs argues that the market instability did not stem from the algorithm underpinning UST but was a result of orchestrated efforts by third-party market participants to manipulate the stablecoin's value. The significant focus is on the trading activities around the May 2022 Depeg event, during which UST lost its peg to the dollar, crashing from $1 to $0.02. In light of this, Terraform Labs significantly narrowed down its subpoena requests, centering on the most critical trading data pertinent to this event. Citadel Securities' response was to provide a single document under the ongoing Confidentiality Order while refusing any further cooperation. The document in question pertains to trading strategies involving Terra-Native Tokens or Terra Financial Instruments between March 1, 2022, and May 31, 2022. Terraform Labs believes that unearthing this data is pivotal to understanding the May 2022 Depeg\u2019s dynamics, examining Citadel Securities' involvement, and whether there was a coordinated endeavor to short UST. The motion filed accentuates the necessity for Citadel Securities to disclose the limited trading strategy information, urging the court to either grant this motion or transfer the matter to Hon. Jed S. Rakoff, the presiding judge in the Underlying Action. This motion trails an array of subpoenas issued to various market players, including Citadel Entities controlled by renowned short seller, Ken Griffin. The crux of the matter extends to allegations by the SEC that Terraform Labs, spearheaded by founder Do Kwon, engaged in a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. The SEC criticizes Terraform Labs for purported misrepresentations regarding the stability of UST and the effectiveness of its algorithm in maintaining the $1 price peg. In a secondary narrative, the motion reveals discord chats hinting at Ken Griffin's intention to short UST around May 2022, amplifying the discord between Terraform Labs and Citadel Securities. Despite Citadel Securities' denial of trading TerraUSD in May 2022, as reported by Forbes, Terraform Labs persists in asserting that the requested documents are indispensable for a robust defense. In a bid to expedite a favorable resolution, Terraform Labs has proposed transferring this matter to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York if the court declines to compel Citadel Securities. The ongoing litigation underscores the nuanced and complex nature of cryptocurrency-related cases, shedding light on the potential manipulative practices within digital asset markets.

As the trial of FTX's CEO Sam Bankman-Fried commences, the thief, still unidentified, resumed moving the stolen assets, converting Ether to Bitcoin. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic sheds light on this crypto mystery, unraveling the blockchain trail and revealing the thief's laundering tactics.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-13",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In the shrouded realm of blockchain, the FTX hack that transpired on November 11, 2022, stands as a glaring testament to the cryptic trails a nefarious act can leave behind. The Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, fell prey to an unidentified hacker who made off with a staggering $477 million, plunging the exchange into bankruptcy. The maleficent actor was quick to take to the shadows, embarking on a quest to launder the stolen assets through a maze of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), cross-chain bridges, and mixers. The pilfered assets witnessed a loss of $94 million in the ensuing days, as the thief hastily funneled them through various blockchain services. RenBridge, a service held by FTX's sister company Alameda Research, saw $74 million of the stolen cache. Yet, the bulk of these pilfered assets lay dormant, only to stir again as the Bankman-Fried trial neared, suggesting a deliberate orchestration. The FTX's hacker initial modus operandi was to swap the stolen tokens for native assets, like Ether, to escape the clutches of centralized authorities. Employing DEXs like Uniswap and PancakeSwap, the thief could swap tokens without fear of seizure. This initial laundering act was the precursor to a more sophisticated ploy: cross-chain laundering. The hacker funneled assets through decentralized cross-chain bridges like Multichain and Wormhole, a tactic to obscure the assets\u2019 trail and facilitate further laundering. One notable accomplice in this cryptic narrative was RenBridge. The thief, having accumulated 245,000 ETH now worth around $306 million, utilized RenBridge to transfer 65,000 ETH to the Bitcoin blockchain, further muddying the trail. The sinister irony lies in the fact that RenBridge was operated by Alameda Research, a sister company to the beleaguered FTX. Once the assets were safely harbored in the Bitcoin realm, the thief employed mixers like ChipMixer to cloak their transactions, a tactic often used to thwart tracing efforts. However, as time rolled on, law enforcement clamped down on ChipMixer, pushing the thief towards newer shores like Sinbad, a suspected rebranded version of the sanctioned Blender mixer. Fast forward to September 30, 2023, the dormant assets awoke once more. The thief, adapting to the closing net, turned to THORSwap for laundering, converting a hefty sum of Ether to Bitcoin. THORSwap, however, soon suspended its interface to stem the illicit flow of funds, albeit to little avail as the thief continued to exploit the underlying THORChain bridge. Despite the meticulous blockchain trails unraveled by Elliptic Research, the identity of the FTX's hacker remains shrouded in mystery. Speculations range from an inside job, possibly implicating Sam Bankman-Fried, to external rogue actors linked to North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group or Russia-affiliated criminal networks. The saga of the FTX hack unveils a sinister dance on the blockchain, leaving in its wake a tale of obscure trails, elusive thieves, and the relentless march of illicit digital transactions. The unfolding drama around the FTX hack serves as a stark reminder of the continuous evolution within the crypto laundering realm. As the law enforcement and compliance sectors refine their strategies, so do the criminal minds lurking within the blockchain's cryptic maze. The \"State of Cross-chain Crime\" report by Elliptic unveils the latest typologies and trends in cross-chain criminality, shedding light on the ever-evolving tactics deployed by crypto launderers.

        "detailedArticleContent": "The prosecution has initiated a formal investigation into allegations of cryptocurrency embezzlement and breach of trust involving former Kakao chairman Kim Beom-su and executives of Kakao affiliates. The case has been assigned to the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office Joint Cryptocurrency Crime Investigation Team (led by Lee Jung-real), which conducted its first examination of the complainant on October 11, 2023. The examination of the complainant is the first step in the investigation of the complaint case, signaling the prosecution's commencement of a thorough investigation into the matter. On the day, the prosecution inquired in detail about the main allegations written in the complaint, the legal background, and the extent of the damage. The prosecution has also requested additional data submission regarding the cryptocurrency Klay transactions of Kakao affiliate executives from the complainant. The complainant side mentioned that the request for supplementary data submission was made to compare and contrast the data secured by the prosecution with the content of the complaint. Previously, on September 13, the economic democracy advocacy group, Economic Democracy 21, had filed a complaint against former chairman Kim Beom-su and executives of Kakao affiliates for embezzlement and breach of trust, among other charges. They claimed that Kakao, through its subsidiary, created the cryptocurrency 'Klay' and sold it to investors to collect funds, which were not used for related business but were embezzled instead. If fraudulent unfair transactions under the Capital Market Act are proven, investors who invested during this period can claim compensation for losses caused by criminal acts. The group alleges that embezzlement occurred during the pre-sale process of Klay, with Kakao's subsidiary collecting KRW 150 to 300 billion, which was not used for related business but was misappropriated. The funds collected from the pre-sale should have gone to either Clayton (Singapore corporation) that issued Klay or GroundX (Japanese corporation) that spearheaded blockchain projects, but there is no trace of such funds in the financial statements, as per the complaint. Furthermore, the group contends that executives of Clayton affiliates, i.e., insiders, are accused of embezzling Klay under various pretexts. Through media promotion of 'overseas investment projects,' they created a pretext for siphoning off Klay, which was then received back by the affiliate. Klay is a virtual asset issued by Kakao's subsidiary, Clayton (later rebranded as Crust), and at one point, its market capitalization surpassed KRW 10 trillion. Although once regarded as a testament to the prowess of domestic cryptocurrencies, its price has now plummeted due to insider trading and operational issues. Meanwhile, both Kakao and Clayton stated, \"Many details are yet to be confirmed, and the raised issues are unilateral claims with no basis in fact.\" Recently, Kakao announced an alliance with nine partners to expand commercial services on its blockchain platform, \"Clayton.\" In collaboration with WeMade Entertainment Co.'s subsidiary, WeMadeTree, Kakao aims to develop blockchain-based gaming content.

The delay contradicts the directives of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and gives leeway to crypto lobbyists opposing the rule.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-12",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A group of seven U.S. Senators, including prominent figures Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, submitted a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel. This letter voiced the Senators' concerns regarding a significant delay in implementing a proposed rule concerning tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency brokers. The rule, designed to bridge a substantial cryptocurrency tax gap, has seen a two-year delay, pushing its effective date to 2026 for transactions occurring in 2025. The proposed regulation is a response to the growing crypto tax gap, which, as of 2022, was believed to cost the IRS around $50 billion annually. This loss stems from either consumers' lack of understanding regarding crypto transactions' tax implications or deliberate tax evasion by malicious actors. By instituting reporting requirements for crypto brokers, the rule aims to provide both crypto users and the IRS with essential information to ensure accurate tax reporting and collection. The proposed rule outlines a broad definition of \"brokers\" to include any party facilitating cryptocurrency sales while having knowledge about the seller and the transaction. It also defines \"digital assets\" as a \"digital representation of value\" recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or similar technology. These definitions are in line with the language contained in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, providing a legal basis for the proposed regulations. The Senators expressed their alarm over the self-imposed two-year delay in implementing the rule, arguing that this postponement contradicts the directives of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The delay could potentially lead to a significant loss in tax revenue, estimated to be billions of dollars in the initial years of implementation, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Moreover, the delay offers an extended window for crypto industry lobbyists to undermine the administration's efforts to establish basic reporting requirements, at a time when there's already opposition to the recently enacted reporting mandates. Senator Warren highlighted the broader implications of the delayed rule on October 11, referring to cryptocurrency as a \"not-so-secret financial weapon\" used by Hamas amidst its conflict with Israel. The urgency for implementing crypto tax rules also ties into global concerns regarding the misuse of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities. In light of the concerns raised, the Senators urged the Treasury Department and the IRS to expedite the implementation of the proposed rule to uphold tax law integrity, ensure clarity for law-abiding taxpayers, and secure crucial tax revenue from a largely unregulated crypto sector. They have requested an update on the efforts towards this goal by October 24, 2023. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "creationDate": "2023-10-11",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Cyprus is set to introduce stringent penalties for unregulated cryptocurrency service providers (CSPs), according to the Cyprus Mail. The government has submitted a legislative amendment to the \"Prevention and Suppression of Money Laundering Law,\" aiming to align the country with international anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards. The amendment was presented to the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs on October 10, 2023. The proposed amendments stipulate that all CSPs dealing with crypto assets must register with the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). Failure to comply will result in penalties ranging from fines of up to \u20AC350,000 to imprisonment for up to five years, or a combination of both. This move reflects Cyprus's commitment to minimizing risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing. The Cyprus Bar Association has expressed reservations about the amendments, particularly the requirement for CSPs registered in other EU member states to also register in Cyprus. In response, the Ministry of Finance highlighted that monitoring responsibility for such entities initially lies with the state where they are registered. CySEC is also considering issuing guidelines related to the \"Travel Rule\" to further enhance regulatory oversight. Discussions are ongoing to ensure the proper and timely implementation of this regulation. The Travel Rule, originally part of the Bank Secrecy Act in the US, mandates financial institutions to share transaction details with other institutions involved in fund transfers. This rule, adapted for the cryptocurrency industry, aims to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing by ensuring transaction details \"travel\" with the transfer. In cryptocurrencies, exchanges and wallet providers must share customer information, enhancing transparency and regulatory compliance. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined compliance expectations for cryptoasset businesses regarding the 'Travel Rule' as well, effective from September 1, 2023. The rule mandates the collection, verification, and sharing of transaction information to align with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards. This development is particularly relevant to Cyprus' recent regulatory tightening, as both countries aim to align their cryptoasset industries with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

        "detailedArticleContent": "In light of the significant regulatory strides taken by South Korea in the cryptocurrency domain, the disclosure of 'Compensation Reserve Funds' by domestic crypto exchanges emerges as a resonating move toward bolstering financial safeguards in the burgeoning digital asset market. Leading the pack, Upbit has earmarked KRW 20 billion as a financial buffer, demonstrating adherence to the forthcoming regulatory landscape slated for full implementation in 2024. The recent unveiling of reserve funds by South Korean crypto exchanges aligns with the broader regulatory agenda orchestrated by the government in 2023. Aimed at enhancing user protection, transaction transparency, and market discipline, the new regulatory framework underscores the government's resolve to construct a robust infrastructure for digital assets. Central to this framework is the mandate for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to establish reserve funds, a move epitomized by Upbit's KRW 20 billion earmark. The disclosure of compensation reserve funds by prominent exchanges such as Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone, mirrors the disciplined approach envisaged by the regulatory framework. These financial cushions are devised to mitigate potential adversities like hacking or system failures, thereby reflecting the exchanges' compliance with the imminent regulations. The reserve fund mandate forms a critical facet of the government's strategy to instill a culture of financial prudence and accountability in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency sector. The unveiling of reserve funds is a precursor to the comprehensive regulations set to be rolled out in 2024. As the crypto ecosystem in South Korea continues to mature, adherence to such regulatory stipulations will likely foster enhanced trust and stability. The proactive disclosure by exchanges underscores their preparedness to navigate the evolving regulatory terrain, setting a precedent for market discipline as South Korea marches toward a structured digital asset marketplace.

        "detailedArticleContent": "In an unfolding courtroom drama, key personnel from cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its associated entity, Alameda Research, testified, shedding light on potentially damning financial mismanagement and misrepresentation practices. The revelations came to the forefront during the questioning of Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison by the prosecution, with content provided by Inner City Press. Gary Wang, a former employee of FTX, recounted several episodes where Alameda Research's financial operations raised concerns. Wang mentioned that on Nov 6, a staggering amount of about $100 million was being withdrawn per hour from FTX, which led to a cumulative shortfall of $8 billion. The discourse also touched upon a 'Korean friend' account and allegations about Sam Bankman-Fried (referred to as Sam), the head of Alameda, considering shutting down Alameda due to financial mismanagement. Further, the testimonies elucidated instances where FTX misrepresented its financial health to customers and investors. Ellison, who had a romantic relationship with Sam, revealed that although FTX marketed itself as safe and well-regulated, it had a line of credit on its platform allowing Alameda to withdraw coins even when they didn't have them. Ellison also disclosed that FTX funds, to the tune of ten to twenty billion dollars, were deposited into Alameda's accounts, and were used for various purposes including repaying loans, investments, and stable coin conversions. The courtroom also saw details emerging about personal ventures being funded through loans from Alameda. For instance, Wang admitted to receiving over $200 million in loans from Alameda for venture investments and buying a house. These loans were apparently signed off without consulting lawyers, revealing a lack of due diligence. Ellison's testimony unveiled troubling relationships and ambitions. She mentioned her romantic involvement with Sam and his ambitions to become the President of the United States. Ellison also highlighted a concerning scenario where FTX's equity value was at risk, with a negative figure of $2.7 billion being thrown into the mix, indicating significant financial instability.

The findings underscore the significant role of major crypto trading firms in stablecoin operations, with a detailed examination of USDT's creation and redemption processes.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-10",
        "detailedArticleContent": "A recent disclosure by Conor Grogan, Director at Coinbase, unveiled a noteworthy involvement of Alameda Research in the minting of Tether (USDT) tokens. Through meticulous on-chain data analysis, it was found that Alameda was responsible for minting a massive $39.55 billion of USDT. This figure represents roughly 47% of Tether's circulating supply as of October 10, 2023. A prior report by Protoss had estimated the minting at around $36.7 billion, however, Grogan managed to update these figures by identifying additional wallets associated with the minting process. Alameda's Asset Management and USDT Minting It was further revealed that the amount of minted USDT exceeded Alameda's assets under management (AUM) at the pinnacle of the cryptocurrency market. This data was obtained from information submitted by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to Forbes for their annual World\u2019s Billionaires publication. The revelation implies a significant role played by Alameda in the USDT market, contributing vastly to the stablecoin's circulating supply. Redemptions and Offchain Coordination The process of accurately determining redemptions remains challenging due to Tether's offchain coordination of burns. Unlike other platforms, Tether lacks deposit addresses; hence entities send funds directly to the treasury for redemptions. Grogan speculated that assuming all USDT redemptions from FTX were from Alameda, they would have redeemed $3.9 billion USDT, with the majority transpiring over two days in May during an event termed the Luna implosion. Public Reactions and Further Inquiries The public's reaction to these findings was mixed, with some individuals inquiring about the veracity of the corresponding deposits to Tether's bank account against the minted USDT. Others questioned the methodology employed by Grogan in discovering the additional wallets, to which he responded by citing various sources including public information, court filings, and bankruptcy consolidations wherein the FTX estate was given key control of the Alameda accounts. Insights from 2021 by Alameda\u2019s Former CEO In a discourse dating back to 2021, Sam Trabucco, the former CEO and crypto quant trader at Alameda Research, elaborated on USDT\u2019s trading dynamics. Trabucco discussed the volatility of USDT\u2019s premium over other stablecoins like USDC, attributing it to the complex creation and redemption process for USDT. He further explained how adept firms like Alameda could leverage these price deviations to align USDT\u2019s price closer to $1, especially during instances where it diverged from this peg. The significant quantity of USDT minted by Alameda Research underpins the close relationship between large crypto trading firms and stablecoin operations. Grogan's findings provide a glimpse into the intricate dynamics of USDT's minting and redemption processes, illuminating the mechanisms that assist in maintaining the stablecoin\u2019s peg to the US dollar.

        "detailedArticleContent": "In a recent Twitter thread, Alex Svanevik, the CEO of Nansen.ai, delved into six key trends he believes will significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape in the coming cycle. The detailed thread, posted on October 6, 2023, underscored the blending of fintech with crypto, the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) in gambling, the rise of Real World Assets (RWAs) like T-bills, the promise and challenges of Web3 gaming, the emergence of SocialFi, and the innovative intersection of Physical NFTs with mainstream retail. Fintech and Crypto Convergence Svanevik noted the growing integration of fintech frontends with crypto backends, referencing PayPal's venture into stablecoins and Revolut's support for ETH staking. He also mentioned crypto startups like BasedApp HQ that are increasingly resembling fintech products, forecasting a long-term shift where cryptocurrency technology overhauls traditional fintech backends. DeFi Revolutionizing Gambling The DeFi model, Svanevik suggests, is poised to reshape the gambling and betting industry. By replacing the house's cut with yields on capital, DeFi offers a more equitable framework. Innovations like Layer 2 solutions (L2s) and account abstraction are making decentralized betting platforms more user-friendly. Svanevik highlighted platforms like LooksRare, Rollbit, and PoolTogether as examples of this trend. Real World Assets and Stablecoins The narrative of stablecoins is extending to real-world assets (RWAs), specifically T-bills, as Svanevik pointed out. With platforms like Super State Funds, Mountain USD, and Open Eden Labs leading the way, tokenized T-bills might significantly reduce stablecoin supply. Svanevik expects giants like Circle and Tether to explore this avenue. The Advent of Web3 Gaming Web3 gaming is on the verge of a breakthrough, with several games launching after years of development. Although many will falter, a select few could achieve monumental success. Svanevik is backing projects like PlaySIPHER, MixMobOrigin, and Axie Infinity. SocialFi's Emergence Svanevik acknowledged the real usage of on-chain social platforms like Friendtech, citing Layer 2 solutions and account abstraction as critical enablers. Despite expected iterations and forks, he believes SocialFi is here to stay. Physical NFTs Bridging to Retail Physical NFTs are carving a path to mainstream retail, with Luca Netz leading the way, according to Svanevik. Platforms like IYK App are facilitating other companies to experiment and succeed in this domain. In the thread, Svanevik also encouraged feedback on any missed trends, which led to discussions on leveraging in DeFi and the role of blockchain in fantasy sports, suggesting the cryptocurrency landscape's dynamic and community-driven nature.

        "detailedArticleContent": "GSR Markets Pte. Ltd., the Singaporean subsidiary of global cryptocurrency trading firm GSR, has received In-Principle Approval for a Major Payment Institution licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Announced on October 2, 2023, this regulatory milestone is a significant advancement in GSR's journey to become a fully licensed entity. The approval allows GSR to better serve the cryptocurrency community in both Singapore and the broader Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing its commitment to compliance and governance in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. The In-Principle Approval for GSR comes just a day after Coinbase Singapore revealed that it had secured a full Major Payment Institution licence from MAS. This follows earlier announcements from Circle, Blockchain.com, and Crypto.com, who also obtained MPI licenses earlier this year. The series of approvals from MAS highlights the competitive yet regulated landscape of the cryptocurrency market in Singapore, a jurisdiction that is increasingly becoming a hotspot for blockchain and crypto enterprises. Jakob Palmstierna, CEO of the GSR Group, expressed his gratitude towards MAS for their constructive oversight. He stated, \"We are immensely grateful to MAS for their constructive oversight, which helps shape a growing digital asset ecosystem that we feel proud to be a substantial part of.\" Xin Song, the Group\u2019s COO, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that the In-Principle Approval enables GSR to \"deepen our local client partnerships, and continue in our critical role as a liquidity provider within the ecosystem.\" Singapore has been making strides in establishing itself as a significant player in the crypto and Web3 space. According to recent surveys, 25% of Singaporeans view cryptocurrency as the future of finance, and 32% are either current or past crypto owners. Furthermore, the city-state is home to over 700 Web3 companies, making it a pivotal market for the growth of the crypto and Web3 economy. GSR aims to capitalize on this burgeoning ecosystem by leveraging Singapore as a strategic hub for its Asia-Pacific operations. The In-Principle Approval is more than just a regulatory milestone for GSR; it's a testament to the firm's commitment to adhering to high standards of compliance and governance. As GSR works diligently towards obtaining a full licence, it plans to expand its suite of services and deepen its relationships with institutional clients in the region. The firm remains committed to playing a critical role as a liquidity provider and aims to contribute meaningfully to Singapore's growing digital asset ecosystem. Image source: Shutterstock"

The PoS, announced on September 28, 2023, by COO Seth Melamed, enables the objective verification of asset management, allowing customers easy access to verify their balances. The details of PoS will be published weekly on the Ethereum blockchain, marking a significant step towards enhancing trust and transparency in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-02",
        "detailedArticleContent": "In an effort to enhance transparency and bolster the trust of its customers, FTX Japan has unveiled a blockchain-based technology known as Proof of Solvency (PoS). This initiative was announced by Seth Melamed, the COO of FTX Japan, through a series of tweets on September 28, 2023. The newly introduced Proof of Solvency mechanism enables the company to prove, in an unalterable manner, that the reserves of the exchange surpass the assets held in custody for customers. Proof of Solvency (PoS) is a method utilized to demonstrate a company's capability to meet its long-term financial obligations, merging traditional financial audit practices with blockchain transparency. Highlighted by ICONOMI's blockchain audit conducted by Deloitte on April 5, 2018, PoS comprises two core components: Proof of Liabilities and Proof of Reserves. Through the Merkle Tree approach, individual users can verify their account balances and overall liabilities without disclosing personal information, ensuring data integrity. Proof of Reserves entails disclosing total reserves encompassing digital and fiat assets, verified through blockchain addresses, bank, and exchange account information. Deloitte's audit, covering 80 digital assets, confirmed ICONOMI's $210.2M reserves surpassing its $133.6M liabilities, thus establishing its solvency. This PoS framework enhances transparency, security, and trust among stakeholders while maintaining user privacy. The PoS is a significant stride towards addressing a central issue in the cryptocurrency market and, by extension, traditional financial markets. The technology aims to provide market participants, who have entrusted their assets to exchanges or financial institutions, with increased safety and information transparency. By doing so, it tackles the technical problem of information provision in a secured and transparent manner, which is a matter of concern for many in the industry. FTX Japan has been ardently adhering to legal regulations by strictly managing the segregation of customer assets. However, with the introduction of PoS, the reliance on subjective verification or claims by the management has been replaced with cryptographic proofs such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs. These proofs and the corresponding results are reflected on the blockchain, thus allowing an objective verification of the asset management status by the customers of FTX Japan. The PoS service is available to all customers of FTX Japan as well as the Liquid Japan platform. Customers can easily verify their balances with a mere three clicks via the Liquid GUI. Furthermore, details of the PoS are scheduled to be published weekly on the Ethereum blockchain, according to Melamed. This initiative is seen as a vital step towards resumption, and FTX Japan believes it to be a high-quality service for all participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The launch of the Proof of Solvency by FTX Japan underscores the growing importance of transparency and trust in the evolving digital asset marketplace. By leveraging blockchain technology, FTX Japan has established a robust mechanism to provide clear evidence of its financial solvency to its customers, thereby setting a positive precedent in the industry for security and transparency.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Integrated Ventures Inc. (OTCQB: INTV) disclosed its yearly mining revenues amounting to $3,862,849 with a production of 162.71 bitcoins for the financial period ending on July 30, 2023, according to a press release on September 29, 2023. Despite the increased bitcoin production compared to 108.29 bitcoins in 2022, the company witnessed a revenue dip from $4,871,473. The decreased revenue against a higher bitcoin yield is primarily attributed to the faltering cryptocurrency market conditions during 2023, where the average dollar value of mined bitcoin plummeted to $23,740.44 from $44,986.17 in the preceding year. Integrated Ventures' financial highlight unveiled a net income loss of $25,459,967 for 2023, significantly up from the $688,003 net loss in 2022. The stark increase in net income loss was largely driven by expenses including a depreciation expense of $3,597,346, loss on disposition of mining equipment amounting to $1,197,522, impairment of mining equipment valued at $5,574,363, and a noteworthy annual stock compensation to management, valued at $15,247,500. Excluding these expenses, the annual income loss would stand at $458,736. The gross loss for the year was reported at $6,297,476, primarily due to an uptick in depreciation expense which totaled $3,597,346. On excluding this expense, the annual gross profit would have been positioned at $1,162,733. CEO Steve Rubakh acknowledged the challenging cryptocurrency milieu, marked by events like the FTX debacle, which impacted mining revenues. Despite these hurdles, the company managed to enhance bitcoin production without additional capital infusion. Furthermore, the management is eyeing fintech sectors emphasizing liquidity, alongside AI\/VR smart glasses\/headsets. Due diligence is underway on two promising projects for potential strategic mergers or asset acquisitions to bolster shareholder value and revenue growth. Integrated Ventures, a Technology Holdings Company, continues to focus on cryptocurrency mining among other tech-oriented domains. The company\u2019s revenue streams presently encompass digital currency mining and hosting. Image source: Shutterstock"

The scenario also underscores the growing frequency of federal shutdowns and the persistent concerns of credit rating agencies over the US's fiscal policymaking, all of which could have broader implications for both traditional and crypto financial markets.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Amidst an imminent government shutdown due to Congress's stalled federal appropriations bill for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2023, the financial sector holds its breath. The potential shutdown's ripple effects are poised to stretch beyond traditional markets, reaching into the cryptocurrency sphere, particularly Bitcoin, according to Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG. Federal Shutdowns: An Emerging Norm The occurrence of federal shutdowns is becoming less sporadic. Over the years, 10 instances have been recorded, with the most recent one in 2018 - 2019 lasting a record 35 days, costing the government an estimated $5 billion. It's difficult to predict a shutdown's duration, as it largely hinges on lawmakers' negotiations. However, the increasing political polarization hints at a longer standoff this time around. Credit Rating Agencies on High Alert Moody\u2019s, holding a AAA credit rating on the US, sounded the alarm on September 27, 2023, cautioning against adverse impacts of a shutdown. This echoes past sentiments, like the 2011 S&P downgrade amidst debt ceiling debates, spotlighting weakened US fiscal policymaking. The persisting discord among political factions continues to unsettle credit rating agencies, potentially foreshadowing broader financial market disruptions. Bitcoin ETF Awaits SEC Green Light A direct casualty of the possible shutdown is the delay in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The furlough would significantly trim down SEC's staff from 4,604 to a mere 437, stalling critical financial product approvals. Notably, the SEC has already postponed decisions on most ETFs, anticipating a prolonged shutdown. The spotlight is on the iShares Bitcoin Trust from BlackRock, among others, awaiting SEC's nod, which now hinges on the resumption of federal operations post-shutdown. Law Enforcement and Financial Regulation: The Dual Impact Two pivotal areas within the crypto realm stand to bear the brunt: law enforcement, chiefly the Department of Justice (DOJ), and financial regulation, predominantly the SEC. While the DOJ is slightly insulated with 84% of its 114,521 staff exempted from furloughs, SEC faces a more stark reality. The severely reduced staff could mean a longer wait for the crypto industry on crucial financial product approvals, particularly the Bitcoin ETF. Market Reactions Amidst Uncertainty Bitcoin nudged up by 1.9% over the week despite the ETF decision delay, possibly finding a silver lining in the US's fiscal woes. Conversely, traditional hedges and markets felt the heat. Gold dipped by 2.9%, the S&P 500 by 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite by 0.2%. The bond market too saw a slump, while oil bucked the trend with a 2.3% rise, reflecting a mixed bag of market reactions as the shutdown looms.

These new ETFs aim to provide a more accessible and regulated avenue for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, without the need for a separate crypto custodian or wallet.",
        "creationDate": "2023-10-01",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Bethesda, Maryland-based ProShares, a prominent player in the crypto-linked ETF market, has announced a significant expansion of its product line. On October 2, 2023, the firm will launch three new exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH). This will be the first ETF specifically designed to track the performance of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In addition to EETH, ProShares is introducing two blended ETFs that aim to offer investors exposure to both bitcoin and ether, the dominant cryptocurrencies in the market. ProShares has been a pioneer in the ETF industry since its inception in 2006. With over $60 billion in managed assets, the firm has been a leader in various investment strategies, including crypto, dividend growth, and geared (leveraged and inverse) ETFs. The launch of these ETFs is a significant milestone in the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. It follows ProShares' earlier successes, including the launch of BITO in 2021 and BITI, the first U.S. short bitcoin-linked ETF, in 2022. These new ETFs are expected to further legitimize cryptocurrency investments and could potentially attract a new wave of institutional investors. Michael L. Sapir, CEO of ProShares, highlighted the growing demand for crypto-linked ETFs, citing the success of their bitcoin-linked ETF, BITO. Launched nearly two years ago, BITO has amassed more than $2 billion in net inflows and has become the largest crypto-linked ETF globally. \"The launch of EETH is a response to substantial investor demand for a regulated financial product that targets ether,\" said Sapir. ProShares is also diversifying its offerings with the Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BETE) and the Bitcoin & Ether Market Cap Weight Strategy ETF (BETH). BETE will undergo monthly rebalancing to maintain a 50\/50 weighting between bitcoin and ether. In contrast, BETH will adjust its holdings based on the market capitalization of the two cryptocurrencies. \"These groundbreaking ETFs offer investors the opportunity to target the performance of the two leading cryptocurrencies through a single transaction and a single ticker,\" Sapir elaborated. One of the key advantages of these new ETFs is their accessibility through traditional brokerage accounts. This eliminates the need for investors to set up a separate crypto custodian, exchange account, or wallet. \"Our crypto-linked ETFs are designed to attract investors who are interested in cryptocurrencies but are concerned about the risks associated with custody or the complexities of direct purchases,\" Sapir noted. Unlike many other investment vehicles, these ETFs do not invest directly in cryptocurrencies. Instead, they primarily invest in ether and bitcoin futures. According to ProShares' research, these futures have historically shown a .99 correlation with their respective cryptocurrencies, offering a near-perfect tracking of the underlying assets.

        "creationDate": "2023-09-29",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States has recently announced the postponement of its decision regarding several proposals for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This decision impacts applications from well-known entities such as BlackRock, Invesco, Bitwise, and Valkyrie, as stated in separate filings made on September 28. The surprise delay, which came two weeks earlier than the anticipated deadline between October 16\u201319, has left many applicants puzzled. Analysts, including James Seyffart from Bloomberg ETFs, suggest that the applications submitted by Fidelity, VanEck, and WisdomTree might face similar delays. The timing of these delays is directly linked to the looming shutdown of the United States government, expected to commence on October 1 or possibly even earlier, according to James Seyffart. This situation is poised to disrupt various federal agencies, including financial regulators. This means we are expecting all #Bitcoin ETF's squared in Magenta to get their Delay orders today or tomorrow. (these are early due to the govt shutdown) The SEC's decision to postpone a significant number of spot Bitcoin ETF applicants was initially made at the end of August, just as the first deadline was approaching. Market participants now await the SEC's decision, which is expected no later than the middle of March. The Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to postpone the evaluation of spot Bitcoin ETF applications has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and financial markets. These ETFs are highly anticipated by both institutional and retail investors, as they would provide a regulated and accessible way to invest in Bitcoin. The delay, however, is not merely a bureaucratic decision. It is rooted in the practical concerns of the potential U.S. government shutdown. This shutdown, if it occurs, could disrupt the normal functioning of various federal agencies, including the SEC. As a result, the SEC has opted to defer its decisions on these crucial ETF applications to ensure that they are made under stable and secure conditions. The news of the SEC's decision has had a mixed impact on the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, it reflects the SEC's cautious approach to approving Bitcoin-related financial products, which has been a consistent theme in recent years. On the other hand, market participants were hopeful that these ETFs would bring more institutional money into the cryptocurrency space, potentially driving up prices. Investors in cryptocurrency-related assets, including Bitcoin, have been closely watching the ETF approval process. The delay has introduced uncertainty into the market, which often responds negatively to such uncertainties. Bitcoin's price experienced a slight dip in response to the news, but the full extent of the market's reaction remains to be seen. The SEC's decision to postpone the evaluation of spot Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns about a potential U.S. government shutdown has added another layer of complexity to the cryptocurrency regulatory landscape. While it is a temporary setback, it underscores the regulatory challenges that cryptocurrencies face as they continue to gain mainstream attention. Market participants will closely monitor developments surrounding these ETF applications and the U.S. government's funding situation. The decision expected by mid-March will provide clarity on whether these ETFs will finally become a reality. In the meantime, the cryptocurrency market will continue to evolve, with or without the ETFs, as it matures and adapts to changing regulatory dynamics. Image source: Shutterstock"

Amid broader calls for swifter approvals, the SEC's meticulous review approach underscores the regulatory cautiousness enveloping cryptocurrency-based financial offerings.",
        "creationDate": "2023-09-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Key Takeaways * The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extends the review period for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF proposal till January 10, 2024. * The delay follows the regulator's previous postponement, pushing the decision 240 days post the initial application. * This extension aligns with the SEC's recent deferment on GlobalX's Bitcoin ETF, amidst calls from U.S. Representatives for swifter approvals. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has deferred the decision on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application, extending the review period till January 10, 2024, as per the notice released on September 26, 2023. This move marks the second delay following the prior postponement on August 11, which had set November 11 as the decision deadline. The ARK 21Shares proposal, aimed at listing a spot Bitcoin ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, has been under the SEC's scrutiny since its filing on April 25, 2023. The regulatory body published the proposed rule change for public commentary on May 15, 2023, initiating a timeline for approval or disapproval. Extended Review Period The extension comes as the SEC invokes Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, allowing for a 60-day extension beyond the initial 180-day review period. This provision facilitates the Commission in ensuring ample time for a thorough examination of the proposed rule change, especially as it underwent three amendments, with the latest being on July 11, 2023. The regulatory body emphasizes the necessity of this elongated timeframe to adequately address the issues encapsulated in the amended proposal. This move resonates with the SEC's similar postponement concerning GlobalX's Bitcoin ETF offering, further accentuating the cautious approach adopted by the regulator towards cryptocurrency-based financial products. Broader Regulatory Landscape The SEC's cautious stance unfolds amidst a broader call for expedited approvals. A faction of U.S. Representatives recently urged the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, to accelerate the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs, criticizing the existing \"inconsistent and discriminatory standards.\" Despite these pressures, the SEC continues to exhibit a meticulous approach, having not approved any spot BTC ETF listings on U.S. soil. The industry watches keenly as major firms like BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Fidelity await the SEC's verdict on their respective ETF proposals, slated for review in October, with potential extensions leading into March. Implications and Industry Response The SEC's decision prolongs a period of uncertainty for ARK 21Shares and other stakeholders keen on advancing Bitcoin ETF offerings. The delay also mirrors the regulatory hesitancy, keeping many in the industry and investors on edge as they await a favorable nod that could potentially unlock a significant capital influx into the cryptocurrency realm. The regulatory trajectory also casts a spotlight on the SEC's ongoing deliberation in assimilating crypto-based financial products within the conventional regulatory frameworks, a narrative that continues to evolve with the rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Key Takeaways * Brian Armstrong condemns Chase UK's decision to restrict crypto-related transactions * The move prompts dialogue with UK officials regarding the country's crypto policy * The ban poses challenges for Coinbase's expansion ambitions in the UK Brian Armstrong, the Chief Executive Officer of the major United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, has expressed disapproval over Chase UK\u2019s recent decision to halt all crypto-related transactions. Armstrong shared his criticism publicly through a post on X (formerly Twitter) on September 26, 2023, describing Chase UK's move as \"totally inappropriate.\" Reaction to Transaction Ban Armstrong\u2019s comments came in response to the news that Chase UK, a subsidiary of JPMorgan, has resolved to decline all customer transactions related to cryptocurrency, citing a high level of fraud associated with crypto transactions as the primary reason. The bank confirmed this stance to Cointelegraph on the same day. According to Chase UK, customers attempting to carry out crypto-related transactions will receive a declined transaction notification. In his post, Armstrong urged crypto holders in the UK to close their Chase accounts as a form of protest against this restrictive measure. He also beckoned UK officials, including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Economic Secretary Andrew Griffith, to evaluate whether Chase UK\u2019s actions align with the broader policy goals of the country concerning cryptocurrency. Implications for Coinbase This development could potentially hinder Coinbase\u2019s aggressive expansion efforts in the UK and Europe. According to the official website of Coinbase, the platform supports transactions in the UK, alongside the US, Europe, and Canada. In April 2023, Coinbase had expressed its serious commitment to expanding its operations in the UK and Europe. This ambition, however, may face challenges given the restrictive stance of major financial institutions like Chase UK towards cryptocurrency transactions. While the UK and European markets present significant growth opportunities for Coinbase, the firm has also been dealing with legal hurdles in the US. Notably, in June 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging violations of securities laws.

        "creationDate": "2023-09-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Key Takeaways * Marco Ruiz Ochoa pleads guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in U.S. District Court. * IcomTech, founded in 2018, falsely promised guaranteed daily returns on cryptocurrency investments. * The scheme involved lavish events and promotional tactics to lure victims. The Guilty Plea Marco Ruiz Ochoa, the former CEO of IcomTech, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on September 27, 2023, before U.S. District Judge Jennifer L. Rochon. The announcement was made by Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Ochoa's guilty plea is part of a broader investigation into IcomTech, a large-scale cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors by promising guaranteed daily returns on cryptocurrency investments. The Scheme's Operations IcomTech was initially founded in 2018 by David Carmona, with Ochoa serving as the CEO until 2019. The company falsely claimed to engage in cryptocurrency mining and trading, promising investors high returns. In reality, the company did not engage in any such activities. Funds from new investors were used to pay older investors and for personal enrichment of the promoters, including Ochoa and his co-defendants David Carmona, Juan Arellano, Moses Valdez, and David Brend. Promotional Tactics The promoters of IcomTech, including Ochoa, traveled extensively both within the United States and internationally to host events aimed at attracting more investors. These events often featured luxury cars and clothing to give an impression of legitimate success. Despite the festive atmosphere, most investors were unable to withdraw their so-called profits and ultimately lost their entire investments. Victim Complaints and Collapse As early as August 2018, investors faced difficulties in withdrawing funds from their online portal accounts. When complaints arose, IcomTech promoters offered proprietary crypto tokens, known as \"Icoms,\" claiming they would eventually hold significant value. These tokens turned out to be worthless, leading to further financial loss for the victims. By the end of 2019, IcomTech ceased payments and collapsed. Legal Consequences Ochoa, 35, of Nashua, New Hampshire, now faces a maximum term of 20 years in prison for his role in the scheme. The case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit, with assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Related Event Just a day before Marco Ruiz Ochoa's guilty plea in the IcomTech case, Pablo Renato Rodriguez, co-founder of AirBit Club, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for a similar cryptocurrency pyramid scheme. Announced by U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, Rodriguez and his co-defendants have been ordered to forfeit approximately $100 million in assets. The sentencing comes as a reminder of the recurring issue of cryptocurrency scams, with co-defendants awaiting sentencing in early October 2023. Image source: Shutterstock"

Rodriguez and co-defendants ordered to forfeit approximately $100 million in assets. Co-defendants await sentencing; previous involvement in pyramid schemes revealed. Background and Conviction Pablo Renato Rodriguez, co-founder of AirBit Club, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on September 26, 2023, by U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels. The sentencing was announced by Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Rodriguez was convicted for his role in orchestrating a global pyramid scheme through AirBit Club, a purported cryptocurrency mining and trading company. The co-defendants, Gutemberg Dos Santos, Scott Hughes, Cecilia Millan, and Karina Chairez, have pled guilty and are awaiting sentencing. Deceptive Practices AirBit Club was founded in 2015 by Rodriguez and Dos Santos. They falsely promised investors guaranteed profits in exchange for cash investments in club memberships. The company was marketed as a multilevel marketing club in the cryptocurrency industry. However, no actual Bitcoin mining or trading took place on behalf of the investors. Instead, Rodriguez and his co-conspirators used the money for personal expenses and to finance more recruitment events. Asset Forfeiture Rodriguez and his co-defendants have been ordered to forfeit their fraudulent proceeds, which include assets consisting of U.S. currency, Bitcoin, and real estate currently valued at approximately $100 million. Previous Legal Troubles Before AirBit Club, Rodriguez and Dos Santos were sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for another pyramid scheme known as Vizinova, and paid $1.7 million in disgorgement and fines. Upcoming Sentencings Dos Santos, Millan, Chairez, and Hughes have pled guilty to charges including wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and bank fraud conspiracy. They are scheduled to be sentenced in early October 2023. Cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes are not uncommon in a world where regulatory oversight is still catching up. On September 28, 2022, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced the eighth distribution of over $4 billion to victims of the Madoff Ponzi scheme, which was not cryptocurrency-related but serves as a reminder of the recurring nature of such fraudulent schemes.

Foreign VASPs are prohibited from operating in Taiwan without proper registration. The guidelines were released on September 26, 2023, and aim to improve investor protection. Regulatory Framework Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has taken steps to regulate the cryptocurrency market by releasing guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) on September 26, 2023. The guidelines cover a range of issues, including the separation of exchange treasury assets from customer assets, mechanisms for listing and delisting virtual assets, and internal control systems. Foreign VASPs Face Restrictions The FSC explicitly stated that foreign VASPs are not allowed to provide services in Taiwan unless they have been registered in accordance with Taiwanese law. This move aims to ensure that all VASPs operating in the country adhere to local regulations and compliance standards. Self-Regulation Encouraged The FSC also encourages self-regulation within the cryptocurrency industry. VASP associations are expected to formulate self-regulatory norms based on the contents of the guiding principles. This comes as local exchanges like Maicoin, BitstreetX, Hoya Bit, Bitgin, Rybit, Xrex, and Shangbito have formed the Taiwan Virtual Asset Platform and Transaction Business Association. Global Exchanges in Taiwan Major global crypto trading firms like Binance have also been serving customers in Taiwan. Binance reportedly applied for registration in Taiwan under the Money Laundering Control Act. Other exchanges like Kraken and Bybit have been offering services to clients living in Taiwan. Investor Protection The FSC has emphasized the need for investor protection, especially in light of recent incidents involving foreign crypto exchanges. The guidelines are part of a broader effort to mitigate risks associated with the highly speculative nature of virtual assets. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "detailedArticleContent": "Key Takeaways JCBA (Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association) submits initial proposal for IEO (Initial Exchange Offering) regulatory reform to JVCEA (Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association). The proposal outlines four key agendas aimed at stabilizing the IEO market. The reform aims to enhance user protection and promote domestic IEOs over foreign exchanges. Introduction The Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA), headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo and led by President Hiroshi Hirosue, announced the submission of an initial proposal for the reform of the IEO (Initial Exchange Offering) system. The proposal was developed by the ICO & IEO Subcommittee, chaired by Seihiro Yoshida, and submitted to the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), led by President Genki Oda. Background and Current Issues Since May of this year, the ICO & IEO Subcommittee has been actively discussing the future of the IEO system, leveraging insights from various businesses involved in cryptocurrency and Web3. The proposal consolidates these discussions and has been submitted to JVCEA, a self-regulatory body for cryptocurrency exchanges and related derivative trading. Four Agendas for IEO Reform The proposal outlines four key agendas for reform: Price Determination: Diversification of pricing methods and explicit warnings about pricing. Liquidity: Setting liquidity targets at the time of listing and ensuring a conducive environment for liquidity. Price Stability: Establishing rules for price stabilization measures at the time of listing. Sale Restrictions: Formalizing and tightening lock-up regulations for issuers and underwriting exchanges. Future Directions The proposal is an initial draft discussed solely within the JCBA. Future discussions will involve various stakeholders and focus on the feasibility of implementing these reforms within the scope of self-regulatory rules. The reform aims to encourage users to manage their assets under Japanese regulations rather than using foreign exchanges, thereby enhancing user protection.

The company now holds a total of 158,245 Bitcoins, acquired at an average price of $29,582 per Bitcoin. The acquisition comes amid a period of relative price stability for Bitcoin, which is currently trading around $26,000. Strategic Investment MicroStrategy, a leading business intelligence firm, has further solidified its position as a significant Bitcoin investor by acquiring an additional 5,445 BTC. The announcement was made by Michael Saylor, the company's co-founder and executive chairman, on X (formerly known as Twitter) on September 25, 2023. The acquisition was completed for a total cash payment of $147.3 million, averaging $27,053 per Bitcoin. Regulatory Filing Details According to a Form 8-K filing submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the latest acquisition took place between August 1 and September 24, 2023. As of the latter date, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries control approximately 158,245 Bitcoins. These assets were acquired at an average price of $29,582 per Bitcoin, inclusive of all fees and expenditures. The aggregate purchase price for all Bitcoin assets held by the company stands at around $4.68 billion. Market Context The acquisition comes at a time when Bitcoin prices have shown relative stability, hovering around the $26,000 mark for several weeks. After peaking close to $28,000 on August 29, the cryptocurrency hit a low of $25,000 on September 11. According to data from CoinGecko, the current market price of Bitcoin is $26,081, representing a 1.9% decrease over the last 24 hours and a 4% decrease over the past week. Company's Bitcoin Strategy This latest acquisition reinforces MicroStrategy's bullish stance on Bitcoin. Earlier in June 2023, the company purchased 12,333 Bitcoins for a total of $347 million, at an average price of $29,668 per coin. Notably, MicroStrategy reported its first profitable quarter since 2020 in Q1 2023, thanks in part to a one-time income tax gain.

        "detailedArticleContent": "Key Takeaways Crypto.com mistakenly transferred $10.5 million AUD to Thevamanogari Manivel's bank account in May 2021. The error was discovered in December 2021 during an annual audit. Manivel has been sentenced to an 18-month community corrections order, while her partner, Jatinder Singh, will face a plea trial on October 23, 2023. The Multi-Million Dollar Error In May 2021, Thevamanogari Manivel attempted to transfer $100 AUD to her partner Jatinder Singh's Crypto.com account. Due to a mismatch between the bank account and the Crypto.com account names, the cryptocurrency exchange issued a refund. However, a clerical error led to $10.5 million AUD being transferred to Manivel's Commonwealth Bank account instead. The mistake remained undetected until December 2021, when Crypto.com conducted its annual audit. Legal Consequences Manivel was arrested in March 2022 while attempting to board a flight to Malaysia with close to $11,000 in cash. She has recently pleaded guilty to recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime and was sentenced to an 18-month community corrections order, including six months of intensive compliance and unpaid community work. She had already spent 209 days in custody prior to the sentencing. Singh, on the other hand, is set to face a plea trial on October 23, 2023, for theft charges. Asset Recovery and Company Response The couple allegedly spent the funds on four houses, vehicles, and other assets, and transferred around $4 million AUD to a Malaysian bank account. One of the properties, a five-bedroom house in Craigieburn, was sold for $1.27 million AUD. Crypto.com has since updated its internal processes to prevent similar incidents. The company declined to comment on the ongoing case. Visa and Future Plans The legal proceedings have added uncertainty to Manivel's visa process. She is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in science. Singh was charged with theft and is due to face a plea hearing on October 23. Image source: Shutterstock"

        "articleSummary": "\"NGMI\" is a term used in the cryptocurrency community to describe individuals or projects considered unlikely to succeed due to hasty or uninformed choices. It serves as a warning label, mockery, and a reflection of market sentiments. The term is often used during market downturns to signal projects that the community believes won't recover. However, it's crucial to understand its context before making investment decisions.",
        "creationDate": "2023-09-20",
        "detailedArticleContent": "Definition \"NGMI\" is an acronym that stands for \"Not Gonna Make It.\" Predominantly used within the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, it refers to individuals, projects, or decisions perceived as unlikely to succeed, often due to hasty or uninformed choices. Beyond the crypto realm, it's an internet slang term that expresses a sense of hopelessness, reflecting feelings of frustration or disappointment. Origins The exact origins of \"NGMI\" are not definitively traced to a single source. However, its widespread use in the cryptocurrency community has made it a staple term, especially on platforms like Twitter, Discord, and other social media channels where crypto enthusiasts congregate. A prime example of its use can be seen in a tweet by @Dehkunle (Dehkunle Of Africa 🐐), who humorously expressed his dismay with the phrase: \"Rugged by Elon Musk and Vitalik on the same day \u2013 ngmi 😂.\" This tweet encapsulates the unpredictable nature of the crypto world, where influential figures can sway market sentiments in an instant, and the community uses terms like \"NGMI\" to humorously cope with such rapid shifts. Source: Twitter Usage in the Crypto Community In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, \"NGMI\" serves multiple purposes: Warning Label: The term acts as a cautionary label, warning against poor investment decisions. For instance, it might be used to describe someone who has made uninformed investment choices. Market Downturns: The term gains traction during market downturns, signaling projects or ventures that the community believes won't recover or achieve success. Mockery: It's also employed, sometimes humorously, to mock individuals who express skepticism about crypto, metaverse, blockchain and web3 concepts. Humorous Doubt: \"NGMI\" can be used in a humorous or self-deprecating manner. For instance, it might be commented on Twitter posts as a lighthearted way to express doubt and poke fun at the hype surrounding a particular project, such as a meme coin with a funny name or an NFT project with an absurd idea. Contrasting Term - WAGMI \"WAGMI,\" standing for \"We're All Gonna Make It,\" serves as the optimistic counterpart to \"NGMI.\" While \"NGMI\" points to potential failures, \"WAGMI\" is an expression of hope and camaraderie within the crypto community, emphasizing collective success and support. Implications While \"NGMI\" can be seen as a negative term, its presence in crypto discussions can be beneficial. By identifying potential pitfalls in the market, traders and investors can redirect their focus towards more promising ventures. However, as with all slang and jargon, it's crucial to approach the term with a discerning mind, understanding its context before making investment decisions. In the Broader Context Outside the crypto world, \"NGMI\" serves as a humorous counter to the more optimistic \"To the moon!\" phrase. While the latter expresses excitement and optimism about potential growth, \"NGMI\" humorously conveys the opposite, often reflecting skepticism or doubt about a particular venture's success. Conclusion \"NGMI\" has carved its niche in the lexicon of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and internet users at large. Serving as both a warning and a reflection of market sentiments, it captures the volatile nature of investments and the ever-changing dynamics of the digital world. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, terms like \"NGMI\" will remain integral in shaping discussions, guiding both seasoned traders and newcomers in navigating the intricate world of digital assets and online trends.

        "detailedArticleContent": "At the latest Group of 20 (G20) summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India highlighted the need for international collaboration in crafting cryptocurrency guidelines. With India holding the G20 presidency, it is actively pushing for a cohesive global strategy on cryptocurrency governance. The G20, comprising 19 countries and the European Union, serves as a pillar for the world's dominant and emerging economies. It plays a crucial role in reinforcing international structures and decision-making on key global economic concerns. In an interaction with a domestic publication, Modi delved into the future of nascent technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency. He emphasized their potential to influence globally, stressing the need for regulations that transcend national boundaries. Drawing an analogy with the aviation sector, Modi noted that in the same way there are standardized rules for air traffic and security, cryptocurrencies should be governed by global standards. Modi elaborated on India's contributions to the global crypto dialogue, stating, \"India\u2019s G20 presidency expanded the crypto conversation beyond financial stability to consider its broader macroeconomic implications, especially for emerging markets and developing economies. Our presidency also hosted enriching seminars and discussions, deepening insights into crypto assets.\" On August 1, India released a presidency note detailing its perspectives on a global framework for cryptocurrency. This note aligned with guidelines from the Financial Stability Board, the Financial Action Task Force, and the International Monetary Fund, while also incorporating additional suggestions tailored to developing economies. Despite India's push for a global crypto framework, the nation's own regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains ambiguous, marked by high taxation and a lack of clarity. In 2022, India introduced a 30% tax on cryptocurrency gains, which resulted in a significant departure of emerging crypto companies and a marked decrease in cryptocurrency trading activity. The G20's role in international economic cooperation is crucial in addressing and harmonizing regulations for emerging technologies. With India at the helm of the G20 presidency, the country is poised to influence the global conversation on cryptocurrency regulations, emphasizing the importance of a unified approach.

        "creationDate": "2023-08-28",
        "detailedArticleContent": "The cryptocurrency landscape in Brazil is currently overshadowed by a high-profile investigation involving football icon Ronaldinho Gaúcho. The former Paris Saint-Germain, F.C Barcelona, and AC Milan player is facing legal scrutiny over his alleged ties to a cryptocurrency scam, casting a shadow on celebrity endorsements in the volatile crypto market. At the heart of the matter is Ronaldinho's venture, '18kRonaldinho'. The company is under the lens for promising clients daily returns of over 2% through cryptocurrency investments. A significant lawsuit, intertwined with a broader probe into crypto frauds in Brazil, is seeking damages exceeding $61 million, citing the company's failure to deliver on its promises. The intrigue deepened when Ronaldinho missed a congressional hearing on August 24, marking his second such absence. While \"adverse weather conditions\" were cited as the reason, the missed appearance has only intensified the legal spotlight on him. Congressman Aureo Ribeiro has indicated that another opportunity for testimony has been set for August 31. If Ronaldinho remains absent, the situation could escalate with potential law enforcement intervention. In a twist to the narrative, Ronaldinho's legal representatives have positioned him as merely an \"ambassador\" for '18kRonaldinho'. They argue that his image and name were leveraged without proper consent, painting him as another victim of the alleged scam rather than a perpetrator. Further complicating the situation is Ronaldinho's brother, Roberto de Assis, who attended a recent hearing. Assis conveyed that Ronaldinho has been actively cooperating with ongoing investigations and has previously provided clarifications to Brazil's Public Ministry. However, lawmakers are insistent on hearing directly from Ronaldinho. This isn't the first time Ronaldinho has been embroiled in legal controversies. A 2020 incident saw him and his brother arrested in Paraguay over counterfeit passports, resulting in a 170-day jail term. The current crypto investigation, with Assis's involvement, adds another layer to the unfolding story. As the events continue to unfold, they underscore the potential pitfalls of celebrity endorsements in the crypto sector. Both the football and crypto communities are keenly awaiting further developments, seeking clarity on Ronaldinho's involvement and the broader implications for the crypto industry.
